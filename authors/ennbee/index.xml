      <title>Risk Based Windows 11 Feature Update Deployment - Feature Updates</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re almost there now; we&amp;rsquo;ve generated and captured the data from a Feature Update Readiness Report and we&amp;rsquo;ve tagged and grouped devices based on their readiness state using Dynamic Security Groups. All of this is useful when deploying a Windows 11 Feature Update, in this instance 23H2, to devices, so let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we actually deploy the new Feature Update to these groups of devices and get you on your Windows 11 journey.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d strongly suggest, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, skimming over the first part of this series as this will give you a good understanding of where we started, and hopefully where we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get to with putting the Feature Update Readiness Reports in Microsoft Intune to good use allowing for a risk based deployment approach of Windows 11 23H2.</description>

      <title>Software Update Deployment Rings for Managed macOS Devices</title>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting a little while to put this post together, as unlike the monthly release of Windows Updates, macOS updates come few and far between, with the recent release of Sonoma 14.</description>

      <description>At the time of writing we are only a few hundred days away from the end of support of Windows 10 22H2, and really we should all be recommending the move to Windows 11, not just because it&amp;rsquo;s shiny and new, but also it&amp;rsquo;s going to actually get security updates.</description>

      <description>Silently encrypting Windows 10 and later devices in Microsoft Intune isn&amp;rsquo;t anything new, removing reliance on Administrator permissions to encrypt a device during either Windows Autopilot or otherwise, as long as your configuration meets the pre-requisites and you&amp;rsquo;re only using a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) as a pre-boot authentication method.</description>

      <title>Creating Reusable Groups of Firewall Settings for Microsoft Online Services</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been living under a rock, or you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with firewall and proxy requirements for accessing Microsoft Online services, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t be aware that Microsoft publish their URLs and IP addresses for their services using a web service.
Sadly I don&amp;rsquo;t live under a rock, and when I get the pleasure working with customers who are blocking all inbound and outbound traffic from Windows devices unless there is a matching firewall rule, getting these devices to talk to Microsoft Intune and other Microsoft services, can be a bit of a pain without the web service as a reference.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Approach to Microsoft Update Deployments</title>
      <link>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/flexible-update-deployments/</link>

      <guid>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/flexible-update-deployments/</guid>
      <description>So this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at improving the management of updates using Microsoft Intune, and probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time either, especially with declarative device management looming, for Apple and hopefully Windows devices, covering configuration of software updates.
But with the introduction of the Windows Autopatch service, and getting hands on with it recently, it prompted me to revisit my previous approach to phased update delivery, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share my findings, this time across not just Windows Updates.</description>

      <title>Custom Backgrounds for macOS New and Classic Microsoft Teams Apps</title>

      <guid>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/macos-teams-new-backgrounds/</guid>
      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at deploying backgrounds for Microsoft Teams on macOS, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we answered an internet strangers question, and hopefully my scripting has come on a little way since then (spoiler: it hasn&amp;rsquo;t).
Now that the &amp;lsquo;New&amp;rsquo; Microsoft Teams app is the de facto version available to download from Microsoft replacing the &amp;lsquo;Classic&amp;rsquo; one, we should at least look at how it handles uploaded backgrounds and if required update our existing script to support not only the &amp;lsquo;Classic&amp;rsquo; version, but the &amp;lsquo;New&amp;rsquo; version too.</description>

      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;re all onboard with the New Microsoft Store, and deploying both UWP and Win32 apps from Microsoft Intune is an absolute breeze, and reduces the effort of deploying applications to a click click next OK exercise. What about the UWP apps that are already installed on a Windows Autopilot device, shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we give them a bit of love?</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been under a rock, or like me, don&amp;rsquo;t have to manage updates on a Windows device estate any more, chances are you might not have seen the issues with the size of the Windows Recovery Environment or WinRE, partition when applying Windows Updates like KB5034441, luckily Microsoft released a &amp;lsquo;fix&amp;rsquo; for this in KB5028997 to resize the partition to allow for updates to install.</description>

      <description>Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve spent time getting your Windows devices enrolled into Intune, they&amp;rsquo;re all getting Device Compliance policies, and you&amp;rsquo;ve finally pulled the trigger on your shiny new Conditional Access Policy that require device compliance for all your users across Windows devices, and low and behold, you&amp;rsquo;ve broken access to Microsoft 365 authenticated services from your Remote Desktop service environment, or even VDI environments.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced the joys of migrating Group Policy and in particular Windows Defender Firewall rules away from Group Policy to Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably encountered the Rule Migration Tool, and for now this tool has worked well, beavering away grabbing firewall rules from a source Windows 10 or later device and punting them straight in Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <description>You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune.
With Configuration Manager having the backing of Microsoft SQL, and a hardware inventory that collects every granular detail about Windows devices, splitting out your device estate into logical phases is very easy to achieve.</description>

      <description>We looked at some of the ways to secure macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, aligned with the NCSC platform guidance in macOS National Cyber Security Centre Security Settings in Intune, but this was when macOS device management in Intune was, at best, in beta.
General hardening has been covered previously by Hubert Maslowski in their post that covers device compliance and configuration settings, but we&amp;rsquo;re looking at ensuring that the macOS devices meet the National Cyber Security Centre settings, including Cyber Essentials requirements.</description>

      <description>Fresh off the back of a trawl of a Modern Endpoint Management LinkedIn group, someone wanted the ability to assign existing Settings Catalog profiles in Microsoft Intune to additional Groups&amp;hellip;this sounded like a quick win if you fancy manually doing it, but no one wants that, and as I had experience of dealing with the logic when assigning apps, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go.</description>

Microsoft have come to the rescue with their Custom Compliance Settings, so let&amp;rsquo;s utilise this detect and check policy, and leverage it to detect and report on Non-Microsoft Antivirus products, their real time protection status, as well as whether the definitions are up to date.</description>

      <description>Nothing has really changed in the Hybrid Join Autopilot space when it comes to device names, and we&amp;rsquo;re still stuck with useless naming conventions for these devices; sometimes a prefix and random characters just isn&amp;rsquo;t a good enough identification method for Windows devices.
So now that it&amp;rsquo;s 2023 it was time to look at this problem once again, mainly because my old solution broke device certificates and an Always On VPN connection that relied on them as part of the Autopilot process.</description>

Tired of manually reinstalling the client from the Console? Wanting a quick and easy way to keep on top of migrated devices? You&amp;rsquo;re in luck.
Problem Time # With the migration of clients between Configuration Manager environments, or between domains that Configuration Manager manages devices on, you&amp;rsquo;ll inevitably be in the situation where you need to reinstall the client on these devices to ensure that communication still occurs between the client and the Management Point.</description>

      <description>So it turns out that Android based MTR (Microsoft Teams Rooms) want to enrol into Microsoft Intune using what we generally term as a legacy enrolment method in Android Device Administrator, one in fact, that is recommended to be disabled for &amp;lsquo;All Users&amp;rsquo; as it will take priority over Android Enterprise Personal Device Work Profile enrolment for personal device or BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) scenarios.</description>

      <description>With the impending retirement of the Azure AD Graph API and ADAL authentication methods, and by impending, I mean the end of 2022, we should probably look at how we move away from the existing authentication methods I&amp;rsquo;ve been using in all of my scripts and into the new realms of MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library).</description>

      <description>So one of those rainy days is here, finally, and as I mentioned in a previous post many months ago, I said I&amp;rsquo;d look at ways to update other update based compliance policies periodically.
That time is now, and although we&amp;rsquo;re not focussing on other Operating Systems, we&amp;rsquo;re going to have a look at updating a Microsoft Defender compliance policy with the latest platform update version.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all had to add Managed Google Play Apps in bulk to Microsoft Intune for your Android Enterprise enrolled devices, whether this is just the raft of Microsoft Apps now that all your data is in Office 365, or the hundreds you have in a rival MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution that you&amp;rsquo;re looking to migrate away from.</description>

      <description>Everyone likes managing clients apps in Microsoft Intune, the grind of packing Windows apps, the chore of selecting Managed Google Play apps, the joy of assigning Apple VPP app licenses in Apple Business Manager&amp;hellip;all good fun.
What about assigning App Categories, do you want to be manually updating hundreds of Apps with categories?</description>

      <description>What happens if you&amp;rsquo;ve allowed Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS devices to enrol into Microsoft Microsoft Intune in all kinds of ways, and now you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where devices that should be marked as corporate are marked as personal or unknown?
This is more of a common situation than you think, with the need to get remote devices managed in a timely fashion, many organisations used User Driven enrolment methods, such as via the Company Portal, to enrol devices into Microsoft Intune, and without Corporate Device Identifiers, or for the case of Windows no support for them, these devices get enrolled as personal devices.</description>

      <description>You may be using Direct Membership Rules in your Microsoft Configuration Manager environment, but should you really for critical production collections?
No is the answer, there I said it. Mainly because they require actual effort and overhead to maintain, and secondly because there have been times where these memberships just plain disappear, for many different reasons, but primarily if the ConfigMgr Client is reinstalled on the device.</description>

      <description>What if you&amp;rsquo;ve only got Microsoft Intune to configure your Dell BIOS settings and not the glory that is Configuration Manager? How much do you like PowerShell, Win32 Apps and passwords in plain text?
Well you&amp;rsquo;re in luck, I&amp;rsquo;ve thrown together something that can help you out based on a need to ensure that Secure Boot is configured for Dell laptops when it was discovered via the Windows health attestation report that around 80% of the Windows devices had it turned off.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Windows 10 and above Operating System Compliance in Microsoft Intune, and specifically how using &amp;lsquo;Minimum OS Version&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Maximum OS Version&amp;rsquo; is dumb and you should definitely check yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re using this in your environment.
Compliance # If you&amp;rsquo;re already using Microsoft Intune compliance policies, good for you, and extra points if you&amp;rsquo;ve integrated these with Conditional Access policies.</description>

      <description>Now I don&amp;rsquo;t think I promised that I&amp;rsquo;d cover off bulk tagging Autopilot devices in a previous post, but you know, I was running low on things to write about. So here we are.
As I like to practice what I preach, I&amp;rsquo;d left myself the task of updating 1000&amp;rsquo;s of Autopilot devices with a new Group Tag after a successful Proof-of-Concept implementation of a suitable convention and syntax.</description>

      <description>Now if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how to ensure that a number of languages are available for selection to end users on shared Windows 10 devices? The thought hadn&amp;rsquo;t crossed my mind, but then again, you encounter new use cases and requirements on a weekly basis. This was one of those occasions, needing a Library Kiosk machine to have a set of languages available to users upon login to the machine.</description>

      <description>Ever had to add notes to Intune Managed Devices in bulk? Me either, well not until a few weeks ago when I needed an easy way to update the notes field on 100&amp;rsquo;s of devices.
So luckily I stumbled upon a post by Paul Wetter about getting and setting notes on devices using Graph API, and specifically the Beta channel of Graph.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re using Windows Autopilot in some shape or form to deploy Windows 10/11 devices to your users, and you&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the Autopilot dynamic group queries used for targetting these devices, right? Good.
So what if you have multiple deployment profiles, or different device use cases with the same profile, or different user personas, or test and pilot deployments, or a range of applications, configurations or scripts that you want to separate out to the devices or users of the devices?</description>

NCSC do provide documented guides for macOS along with a GitHub repo containing a script and a list of recommended security settings, but what do these look like in Microsoft Intune?</description>
