      <description>With all the hype about Platform SSO on macOS devices, now is the time to try out not just the standard functionality, but the integration into web browsers such as Google Chrome. We take a look at how to configure this using Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <description>Using the data captured from a Windows 11 Feature Update Readiness report to successfully tag device attributes to device objects, and group them based on risk, we now look at how to deploy Feature Updates to these devices in a controlled manner.</description>

      <description>Having looked into capturing the Feature Update Readiness data for Windows 11 23H2 for our Windows devices, we can now use this risk based data to tag them with their associated risk, grouping them together to allow for sensible Feature Update profile assignment.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>

      <description>With the availability of the new Microsoft Teams client for macOS, we should build upon an existing script to deploy backgrounds, and update it to support not just the new version but the classic version as well.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Windows 10 and above Operating System Compliance in Microsoft Intune, and specifically how using &amp;lsquo;Minimum OS Version&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Maximum OS Version&amp;rsquo; is dumb and you should definitely check yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re using this in your environment.</description>

      <description>Now that we know how powerful Autopilot Group Tags can be, we should look into how we can retrofit devices with these Group Tags when the OEM or Supplier didn&amp;rsquo;t bother doing their part of the deal.</description>

      <description>Now if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.</description>

The thought hadn&amp;rsquo;t crossed my mind, but then again, you encounter new use cases and requirements on a weekly basis. This was one of those occasions.</description>

      <description>A hidden gem with Autopilot service, is the Group Tag attribute for Autopilot devices, this tag can be provided during the pre-registration by a supplier or OEM, and can be configured or updated after the device has been imported. What can we use it for in Intune?</description>
