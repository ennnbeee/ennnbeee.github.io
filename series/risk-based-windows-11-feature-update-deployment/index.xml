      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d strongly suggest, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, skimming over the first part of this series as this will give you a good understanding of where we started, and hopefully where we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get to with putting the Feature Update Readiness Reports in Microsoft Intune to good use allowing for a risk based deployment approach of Windows 11 23H2.</description>

      <description>At the time of writing we are only a few hundred days away from the end of support of Windows 10 22H2, and really we should all be recommending the move to Windows 11, not just because it&amp;rsquo;s shiny and new, but also it&amp;rsquo;s going to actually get security updates.</description>
