Am I OK? Probably not, but if you\u0026rsquo;re wanting to empower your users to select when they get their updates, this might be an interesting read, especially when I explain how we\u0026rsquo;re going to achieve this.\nWhy Self-Service Updates? # I mean, why not? As much as updates are there to ensure devices are secure, or as secure as they can be when it comes to operating system vulnerabilities, it is the user that is actually impacted by the installation of updates and enforced device restarts. So why not give them some control over when updates are installing. So how are we going to give the users a choice\u0026hellip;\nMicrosoft Company Portal Device Category prompt. Yeah, Device Categories. In for a penny in for a pound when it comes to bad choices eh?\nDevice Categories? # Yes I know what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking, relying on end users to select the correct device category in the Company Portal, and then using that attribute to group devices to apply update settings sounds like a bad idea, but hear me out, please.\nThe Word of the Day is \u0026ldquo;Inaccurate\u0026rdquo; # First before I convince you that this isn\u0026rsquo;t the worst thing in the world, we should see what the some of the issues are with Device Categories in their general use:\nA user will just select whatever device category they want - this leads to inaccurate assignment of device categories. A Windows user might not ever open the Company Portal - this means a category is never selected and grouping or filtering based on categories becomes inaccurate. An Intune administrator user can rename a category - if dynamic security groups or device filters rely on this category name, then these grouping become inaccurate. Now I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be able to solve all the issues here, especially as there isn\u0026rsquo;t an RBAC setting specifically for Device Categories, but we should be able to deal with a couple of them at least.\nIf you are using Device Categories, I\u0026rsquo;m not coming for you here, but I would be very careful when using them for anything important. Configuring Device Categories # Before you excitedly go and create your new Device Categories, do me a solid and check that your users are actually able to select them from the Company Portal. Go check Tenant Customisation settings in Microsoft Intune, and turn on, if like me you\u0026rsquo;d in anger previously turned off the below option:\nMicrosoft Intune Tenant Customisation. Now that you know how to just turn on or turn off Device Categories, if you\u0026rsquo;re not convinced, turn them off and go find another post to read, otherwise keep reading.\nDays of the Week # If you\u0026rsquo;re still here, and want to see how to let your users choose when they get their updates, we can look at creating the following Device Categories based on the the day of the week:\nDay of Update Device Category Sunday Update my device on a Sunday Monday Update my device on a Monday Tuesday Update my device on a Tuesday Wednesday Update my device on a Wednesday Thursday Update my device on a Thursday Friday Update my device on a Friday Saturday Update my device on a Saturday You can of course name these Device Categories something more suitable to your environment, and limit the days of the week if you\u0026rsquo;d like, just remember that this is an end user selecting a category, so some fancy naming convention won\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make as much sense to them as it does to you.\nWith the Device Categories now in place, we can take on the advice of Microsoft for a change:\nCreate device categories to help organize devices and build dynamic device groups.\nAnd go and create some Dynamic Security Groups in Entra using them.\nDynamic Device Groups # To support the ability for end users to get updates on the day they expect, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go and create some new Dynamic Device Groups in Entra.\nWe can not only use these groups for include assignments for our update policies, but also exclude assignments, ensuring that even if an end user doesn\u0026rsquo;t bother opening the Company Portal, that they\u0026rsquo;ll still get some level of update, just maybe not when they want it.\nDevice Category Groups # These are the obvious ones, as we\u0026rsquo;ve created our Device Categories now, we need corresponding groups in Entra that we can use to capture the devices based on the category selected. Obviously my group rule matches my category names, yours might be different.\nDay of Update Group Name Rule Sunday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Sunday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Sunday\u0026quot;) Monday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Monday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Monday\u0026quot;) Tuesday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Tuesday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Tuesday\u0026quot;) Wednesday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Wednesday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Wednesday\u0026quot;) Thursday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Thursday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Thursday\u0026quot;) Friday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Friday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Friday\u0026quot;) Saturday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Saturday (device.deviceCategory -eq \u0026quot;Update my device on a Saturday\u0026quot;) You may have noticed that I\u0026rsquo;m not using any other attributes in these groups, as we\u0026rsquo;re going to use them across all operating system types, and where we can we\u0026rsquo;ll use Device Filters to apply to more granular devices, based on something like device ownership. If you want to be more specific here, and create a set of groups per operating system or per ownership type, go for it, it\u0026rsquo;s your environment after all, just remember that these Device Categories do not care about ownership, operating system, or otherwise.\nSpreading the Update Load # So what if we still want some phasing across supported update policies (it\u0026rsquo;s Windows, only Windows), and you don\u0026rsquo;t want all the users who selected the Update my device on a Thursday Device Category to get the update on the same Thursday?\nWell with a couple of additional Dynamic Security Groups, we can have two update policies for the same day but a week apart, splitting devices roughly in half.\nScope Group Name Rule Initial Production SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and ((device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;5\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;7\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;9\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;e\u0026quot;)) Final Production SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and ((device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;4\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;6\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;8\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;f\u0026quot;)) We\u0026rsquo;ve seen these types of groups before so they shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too much of a surprise to you, but in short, we\u0026rsquo;re splitting all the devices into ~50% groups using the UUID associated with each deviceId object in Entra.\nWe can then use these groups when creating our Windows Update rings for our weekday specific updates.\nSoftware Update Profiles # In the case where we get users who do not select a Device Category for whatever reason, we can build out update profiles in our usual way, whether this be a phased approach or otherwise, but we need to ensure that these policies only apply to devices without a selected update day.\nTo achieve this, we can just exclude our created Device Category dynamic security groups from our existing update policies.\nmacOS Update Policy Exclusions. So for any existing update profiles, make sure you are excluding, in this instance, the seven created groups, allowing devices to get updates regardless of whether a user has bothered to open the Company Portal or not.\nNow on to the weekday specific policies.\nWindows Update Rings # This one requires a little more brain power than the other update policies, all to cope with the idea that you want to split devices across differing weeks, but on the same days.\nAs maths isn\u0026rsquo;t my strong point, we\u0026rsquo;re going to leverage the option to install updates at a scheduled time; this has it\u0026rsquo;s downsides relating to whether a device is actually active during that time of day, but is easier to work out than using deferral and deadline settings that I\u0026rsquo;ve covered previously.\nWith the idea we need to create two update rings for each day to help spread the load, we can create one for Thursday on the first week of the month:\nWindows Update Ring for updates on a Thursday. Assigning this to the Thursday based Dynamic Security Group, but excluding one of our Production groups we created to split devices across update rings.\nCreating a second Update Ring for Thursday, but amending the week of the month and the assignment using the second week:\nWindows Update Ring for updates on a Thursday. Keeping the same include assignment, but amending the exclude assignment to the other Production group.\nNow you\u0026rsquo;ve got your head around that, go create 14 update rings 😅 with the below settings:\nQuality update deferral period (days) - 0 days Automatic update behaviour - Auto install and restart at a scheduled time Deadline for quality updates - 0 days Automatic behaviour frequency: Day of Update Week Include Assignment Exclude Assignment Sunday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Sunday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Sunday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Sunday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Monday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Monday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Monday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Monday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Tuesday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Tuesday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Tuesday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Tuesday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Wednesday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Wednesday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Wednesday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Wednesday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Thursday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Thursday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Thursday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Thursday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Friday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Friday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Friday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Friday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Saturday Second week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Saturday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_B Saturday Third week of the month SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Saturday SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_A Your mileage may vary with which week of the month you\u0026rsquo;re choosing (remembering that the days in the second week might not be after Patch Tuesday), and if you really want to spread things out across the whole month, you can create smaller Production groups and four update rings per day.\niOS/iPadOS Update Policies # On to the easier ones, and for whatever reason, ones that we don\u0026rsquo;t consider to warrant any kind of phasing. So go and create some iOS/iPadOS Update Policies and configure each update policy with the below default settings, making changes only to the Time Window configuration for each day of the week:\nUpdate to install - Install iOS/iPadOS Latest update Schedule type - Update during scheduled time Time zone - UTC±00 (select your own time zone) Time window: Day of Update Time Window Assignment Sunday Sunday 12AM - Monday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Sunday Monday Monday 12AM - Tuesday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Monday Tuesday Tuesday 12AM - Wednesday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday 12AM - Thursday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Wednesday Thursday Thursday 12AM - Friday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Thursday Friday Friday 12AM - Saturday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Friday Saturday Saturday 12AM - Sunday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Saturday You can see an example of how this has been configured below for delivering updates on a Monday:\niOS Update Policy for updates on a Monday. You could, and I mean could, use the same logic behind the Windows update phasing, and split each day into twelve-hour sections, or more if you really hate yourself, and use the Production groups to split the delivery of updates in the morning and afternoon on the same day.\nBut you know, iOS updates don\u0026rsquo;t break devices 🤨.\nmacOS Update Policies # We\u0026rsquo;re almost there, so time for the macOS Update Policies, we\u0026rsquo;re sticking with this profile for now as gives us the behaviour we want, not one of the other options for software updates , configuring each with the default settings below:\nCritical updates - Install immediately Firmware updates - Install immediately Configuration file updates - Install immediately All other updates (OS, built-in apps) - Install immediately Schedule type - Update during scheduled time Time zone - UTC±00 (select your own time zone) Time window: Day of Update Time Window Assignment Sunday Sunday 12AM - Monday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Sunday Monday Monday 12AM - Tuesday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Monday Tuesday Tuesday 12AM - Wednesday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Tuesday Wednesday Wednesday 12AM - Thursday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Wednesday Thursday Thursday 12AM - Friday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Thursday Friday Friday 12AM - Saturday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Friday Saturday Saturday 12AM - Sunday 12AM SG_MDM_Devices_Updates_Saturday macOS Update Policy for updates on a Wednesday. Again, you can split these down to more granular times, but why bother, macOS updates definitely don\u0026rsquo;t break macOS devices 🤐.\nAndroid Update Policies # Yeah, sorry, not an option for Android Enterprise devices, as there isn\u0026rsquo;t support for specific update install days. Let\u0026rsquo;s just let the user think they have some control over their updates here, a little placebo never hurt anyone.\nAndroid Device Restriction Profile. Just create a new Device Restriction profile and set System update under General to be Automatic, no need to even use the Dynamic Security Groups, just go ahead and assign this to all applicable devices.\nUser Experience # Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve got all your Dynamic Security Groups sorted, each Software Update policy created and assigned, across each of the supported operating systems, all is left to do is wait for users to select a Device Category.\nDevice Categories in the Company Portal on macOS. Really your users can\u0026rsquo;t miss them, and with Android, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS enrolment pretty much forcing you to open the Company Portal, you should get some uptake.\nIf you fancy, you could create a new Device Category for \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t care about updates\u0026rdquo;, and leverage that in either existing Dynamic Security Groups to leave the device in your standard Software Update deployment approaches. Summary # If you\u0026rsquo;ve followed along, (and I assume most people switched off when I suggested using Device Categories), you could have some over arching catch-all update policies that will apply updates when you want them to, across as many phases or stages as you see fit and user selected update policies, allowing the user some control, or the semblance of control in some instances, as to when their device is updated and/or restarted all from the selection of a Device Category.\nEmpowering.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to say this is the best approach for update delivery, nor am I suggesting you drop your current software update deployment approach in favour of something entirely user-driven, but I am at least showing you what is possible, with functionality in Microsoft Intune that often gets overlooked, or misused for whatever reason.\n","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/updates-self-service-deployment/","section":"Posts","summary":"Fancy letting your end users select what day of the week they get their device updates allowing them to be truly empowered but still ensure a level of device security, sure you do.","title":"Self-Service Software Update Deployments","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/updates/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Software Updates","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/windows/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Windows 10 and later","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/apps/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Apps","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/co-management/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Co-management","type":"tags"},{"content":"You\u0026rsquo;ve just implemented a Cloud Management Gateway to help your hybrid joined Windows devices communicate to Configuration Manager over the internet, but what if they\u0026rsquo;re orphaned and unable to communicate to Configuration Manager to get the new Client Settings?\nThis one might be little niche if I\u0026rsquo;m honest, but there is a scenario where you\u0026rsquo;ve implemented a Cloud Management Gateway (CMG) as part of your Configuration Manager topology, your hybrid joined Windows devices are co-managed, but they no longer communicate back to the on-premises Configuration Manager Management Point for some reason, and you need to tell these remote devices that they can now use the Cloud Management Gateway.\nThe reason could be that you have a user initiated VPN that no-one actually uses, you\u0026rsquo;re lacking a device tunnel for communication back to on-premises services, or you just have no VPN whatsoever, and these devices have just aged out of Configuration Manager never to be seen again.\nHow on earth are we going to sort these rogue orphaned devices out, and get them back speaking with Configuration Manager and a Cloud Management Gateway?\nClient Communication # Usually after implementing a Cloud Management Gateway, you just wait for your devices to check back in to the Management Point during a location request, and when they\u0026rsquo;re classified as Currently Internet they\u0026rsquo;ll happily communicate with the CMG, as long as they meet the client authentication requirements obviously.\nThis won\u0026rsquo;t work for devices that don\u0026rsquo;t currently talk to Configuration Manager, nor if they\u0026rsquo;ve disappeared from the console and discovery. So how do we deal with this?\nJust Install the Client # Strangely, Microsoft actually recommended just re-installing the ConfigMgr Client on these devices, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad shout, so that\u0026rsquo;s at least the start of the process; with the devices hybrid joined and co-managed for at least the Client Apps workload, we can just package up the latest ConfigMgr client from the Primary Site server and punt it to the device estate.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, but what about using native tooling, isn\u0026rsquo;t there a way to get Microsoft Intune to do this for you?\u0026rdquo;, I hear you cry. Well yes, but also no.\nMicrosoft Entra hybrid joined devices - If the device is targeted with co-management settings policy, in Microsoft Entra hybrid join scenario, the autopilot provisioning times out during ESP phase.\nand\u0026hellip;\nClients that authenticate with PKI certificates. You can\u0026rsquo;t provision the certificate on the device before the Configuration Manager client installs and needs to authenticate to the CMG. Microsoft Entra ID is recommended for client authentication. For more information, see Plan for CMG client authentication: Microsoft Entra ID.\nThe co-management authority setting in Microsoft Intune is great, for your Entra only Autopilot devices, and as covered previously, but just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for the hybrid joined world, so a Win32 app it is, but what else do we need to consider?\nClient Authentication # Before we even look at packaging up the Configuration Manager client, we need to think about how these now essentially Internet-based devices are going to authenticate and communicate to the Cloud Management Gateway.\nAs these aren\u0026rsquo;t fresh out the box devices, we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t need to treat them as such, so we can discard the need of using a site token as part of the installation, as these devices will already be hybrid joined, or have a device certificate to allow existing authentication.\nWith this we can just look at how we make sure the devices are meeting the client authentication pre-requisites for the following two client authentication methods.\nPKI Authentication # I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a stab in the dark and suggest that these orphaned devices, if using PKI authentication, already have a certificate and the full chain of trust required to allow for PKI authentication, but we should be sure of this and not just assume.\nSo as part of our soon to be packaged Win32 app, we need to utilise a PowerShell script to check that a certificate from your Internal Certification Authority exists with the correct extensions, and it\u0026rsquo;s valid using App Requirements in Microsoft Intune.\nThrowing together a quick script and updating the $certCA with the distinguished name of your Issuing Certification Authority, we can loop through all certificates issued to the device, making sure that the certificate has come from your internal CA, then check if the date is valid.\n$ready = 0 $certCA = \u0026#39;CN=ennbee-LAB-CA, DC=ennbee, DC=local\u0026#39; #Certificate Authority Name $date = Get-Date #Used for checking valid certificate $certPath = \u0026#39;cert:\\LocalMachine\\My\u0026#39; $certs = Get-ChildItem -Path $certPath foreach ($cert in $certs) { $certThumbPath = $certPath + \u0026#34;\\$($cert.Thumbprint)\u0026#34; if ($cert.Issuer -eq $certCA -and $cert.Extensions.EnhancedKeyUsages.FriendlyName -contains \u0026#39;Client Authentication\u0026#39;) { $certValid = Get-ChildItem -Path $certThumbPath | Select-Object NotAfter, NotBefore if ($date -gt $certValid.NotBefore -and $date -lt $certValid.NotAfter) { $ready++ } } } if ($ready -gt 0) { Write-Output Ready } If the script finds at least one certificate, as really the Configuration Manager client isn\u0026rsquo;t that fussy about which certificate it uses, just that there is one, the script will return a Ready output back to Microsoft Intune, which we can then use as a positive identifier that the app installation can start.\nEntra Authentication # If you decided that you couldn\u0026rsquo;t be bothered with PKI authentication (I mean who can really?), then the other option would have been to leverage the Microsoft Entra ID join state of the device, and here we\u0026rsquo;re making more broad assumptions that you\u0026rsquo;re meeting all other pre-requisites for this authentication method.\nThe one we care about is the join state, as really this is the only one we can query from the client itself, so more PowerShell and using the ever trusty dsregcmd to get the join state of the device.\n$ready = 0 $dsRegCmd = dsregcmd /status $dsRegOutput = New-Object -TypeName PSObject $dsRegCmd | Select-String -Pattern \u0026#39; *[A-z]+ : [A-z]+ *\u0026#39; | ForEach-Object { Add-Member -InputObject $dsRegOutput -MemberType NoteProperty -Name (([String]$_).Trim() -split \u0026#39; : \u0026#39;)[0] -Value (([String]$_).Trim() -split \u0026#39; : \u0026#39;)[1] } if ($dsRegOutput.AzureAdJoined -eq \u0026#39;YES\u0026#39;) { $ready++ } if ($ready -gt 0) { Write-Output Ready } With a bit of a hack, we can take the output of dsregcmd /status and throw it into a new PSObject, which gives us an sample output of the below:\nAzureAdJoined : YES EnterpriseJoined : NO DomainJoined : YES Virtual Desktop : NOT SET Device Name : XXXXXX Thumbprint : XXXXXX DeviceCertificateValidity : [ 2023-10-31 13:36:52.000 UTC -- 2033-10-31 14:06:52.000 UTC ] KeyProvider : Microsoft Platform Crypto Provider TpmProtected : YES DeviceAuthStatus : SUCCESS TenantName : MEM v ENNBEE With the area we care about being the AzureAdJoined state, which can be referenced with $dsRegOutput.AzureAdJoined in the PowerShell script. Sticking with the Ready output here as well, we now have something we can confirm as part of the requirements for the application installation.\nClient Installation Settings # As we\u0026rsquo;re using Microsoft Intune to push out a packaged version of the client, we can\u0026rsquo;t rely on a standard detection rule such as file , msi, or registry, as there is no guarantee that the version of the client already installed, isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as the one we\u0026rsquo;re trying to deploy.\nTo get around this little hurdle, along with a couple of others along the way including the installation parameter for the ConfigMgr client, we need to create a PowerShell script to carry out the installation for us, taking into consideration the two main authentications methods of PKI and Entra authentication, as well as the requirements for the command line installation.\nCommand Line Installation # For both authentication types, we need the following command line options and switches:\nCCMHOSTNAME - The You\u0026rsquo;ll find the Cloud Management Gateway hostname in the ConfigMgr console under the Cloud Services settings. SMSSITECODE - Is pretty obviously your ConfigMgr site code. SMSMP - Required to specify the internal management point when the client is set to intranet connectivity. /mp - The management point address for the Cloud Management Gateway, it\u0026rsquo;s the one with the \u0026lsquo;https://\u0026rsquo; prefix. /forceinstall will uninstall the existing client first, and is useful if the installed version of the client is the same as the version being deployed. With the PKI authentication we need some additional switches:\n/NoCRLCheck - Useful if the internal PKI environment hasn\u0026rsquo;t a public certificate revocation list (CRL), no needed if you\u0026rsquo;re using a public certificate on the Cloud Management Gateway. /UsePKICert - Tells the installation to use a PKI certificate for authentication to the Cloud Management Gateway. Finally for Entra authentication we need some details from the Enterprise App used for this authentication method when setting up Azure Services in ConfigMgr:\nAADTENANTID - Can be found in your Entra ID tenant. AADCLIENTAPPID - Is the Client ID of the Enterprise App and can be found in Entra ID.

So with all these switches now available, time to put them to good use and create a PowerShell script, that can be used for both authentication methods.\nInstallation Script # As I don\u0026rsquo;t like to repeat myself, we can create one PowerShell script for both authentication types, using a switch parameter to control which of the command line settings are used for the installation, and passing though the details of the below mandatory parameters for both installation types:\nccmSiteCode - ConfigMgr Site Code, so something like \u0026quot;ENB\u0026quot;. ccmMP - The URL of the internal ConfigMgr Management Point such as \u0026quot;https://configmgrmp.ennbee.local\u0026quot;. cmgAddress - The address of the Cloud Management Gateway (without the \u0026lsquo;https://\u0026rsquo; bit, as we\u0026rsquo;re building that for the required parameter), so \u0026quot;CONFIGMGRCMG.CLOUDAPP.NET/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/72186325152220500\u0026quot; For the parameters required for the PKI authentication:\nPKI - A switch parameter that used to create the command line arguments for PKI authentication over Entra authentication. For the Entra authentication method we need to pass through the non-mandatory parameters:\ntenantId - This is the UUID for your tenant, so something similar to \u0026quot;daf4a1c2-3a0c-401b-966f-0b855d3abd1a\u0026quot; clientAppId - The client App object ID from Entra, so for me it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026quot;7506ee10-f7ec-415a-b415-cd3d58790d97\u0026quot; clientAppURL - The client App URI configured in the Enterprise App, like \u0026quot;https://localhost\u0026quot; I\u0026rsquo;ve left these as non-mandatory and without any flight checks, as you\u0026rsquo;re not going to, a) see the output of the script, and b) I trust you to just use the script correctly.\nSo we now have an installation script in all its glory, ready to be packaged along with the ConfigMgr client installation files so we can punt it into Microsoft Intune.\n[CmdletBinding()] param( [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)] [switch]$PKI, [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [String]$ccmSiteCode, [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [String]$ccmMP, [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [String]$cmgAddress, [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)] [String]$tenantId, [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)] [String]$clientAppId, [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)] [String]$clientAppURL ) try { if ($PKI) { $arguments = \u0026#34;/forceinstall /NoCRLCheck /UsePKICert /mp:$(\u0026#39;https://\u0026#39; + $cmgAddress) CCMHOSTNAME=$($cmgAddress) SMSSITECODE=$($ccmSiteCode) SMSMP=$($ccmMP)\u0026#34; } else { $arguments = \u0026#34;/forceinstall /mp:$(\u0026#39;https://\u0026#39; + $cmgAddress) CCMHOSTNAME=$($cmgAddress) SMSSITECODE=$($ccmSiteCode) SMSMP=$($ccmMP) AADTENANTID=$($tenantId) AADCLIENTAPPID=$($clientAppId) AADRESOURCEURI=$($clientAppURL)\u0026#34; } Start-Process -FilePath \u0026#34;$PSScriptRoot\\ccmsetup.exe\u0026#34; -PassThru -Wait -ArgumentList $arguments # Create a tag file just so Intune knows this was run $tagPath = \u0026#34;$($env:ProgramData)\\Microsoft\\CCMCMGInstall\u0026#34; If (-not (Test-Path $tagPath)) { mkdir $tagPath -Force } $scriptName = $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name Set-Content -Path \u0026#34;$tagPath\\$scriptName.tag\u0026#34; -Value \u0026#34;Installed\u0026#34; } catch { $error[0] } To allow us to detect whether the installation of the app has happened, and to avoid using native detection methods, I\u0026rsquo;ve included the creation of a .tag file in the script, which we can look for as part of the detection.

Go and get the latest version of the Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool Extract this somewhere sensible on your computer. Download the Client installation script from my GitHub repo. Place this in the same location as the Configuration Manager client files, where ccmsetup.exe exists in fact. You should now have a folder with the client install content and PowerShell script looking like this:\nConfiguration Manager client installation files. Time to package the files.\nUsing the IntuneWinAppUtil # Now we have all the required files, navigate in an elevated Terminal window to where you extracted the Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool, running a command similar to the below, specifying the source folder (-c) as where you copied the Configuration Manager client installation files, the setup file (-s) as the PowerShell script, and the output (-o) where you want the new intunewin file to be created:\n.\\IntuneWinAppUtil.exe -c \u0026#34;C:\\Source\\Installers\\CCMClient\u0026#34; -s Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.ps1 -o \u0026#34;C:\\Source\\Installers\u0026#34; -q This will hopefully give us an output similar to the below:\nOutput of the Microsoft-Win32-Content-Prep-Tool command. And a new file Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.intunewin in C:\\Source\\Installers ready to be uploaded to Microsoft Intune.\nClient Deployment # The rest of the deployment process happens over in Microsoft Intune so throw yourself over to Windows Apps blade, as we\u0026rsquo;ll need to create two new Win32 apps for each of our authentication methods, uploading the same .intunewin file for both apps.\nBoth applications will have similar App Information, so feel free to amend the wording in this section.\nApp Info section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app. I haven\u0026rsquo;t bothered configuring an app logo, as Microsoft don\u0026rsquo;t 👀. PKI Authentication Application # When configuring the PKI authentication application, our installation command and requirements need to reflect this authentication type, so for our install command we need something like the below:\n\u0026#34;%systemroot%\\sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\u0026#34; -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.ps1 -PKI -ccmSiteCode \u0026#34;ENB\u0026#34; -ccmMP \u0026#34;https://configmgrmp.ennbee.local\u0026#34; -cmgAddress \u0026#34;CONFIGMGRCMG.CLOUDAPP.NET/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/72186325152220500\u0026#34; The uninstall command is just removing the .tag file we create during the installation script:\ncmd.exe /c del %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\CCMCMGInstall\\Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.ps1.tag Program section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app for PKI authentication. Make sure you update the installation time and the installation context otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll be in for a bad time. As we\u0026rsquo;ve taken the time to write a custom requirement rule, we need to add this to the standard requirements section, uploading the script for PKI authentication we created and modified previously, and updating the output data type to String and expected value of Ready accordingly.\nRequirements section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app for PKI authentication. Moving on to the next page in the process, we need to create our Detection rule using the .tag file that gets created during the installation. So go and add a new detection rule using the File option, with the path to the file being %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\CCMCMGInstall and checking if the Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.ps1.tag file exists:\nDetection Rule section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app for PKI authentication. We can skip to the end of the process, as we have no further settings to configure, and I\u0026rsquo;d suggest assigning this on a small Proof-of-Concept group as part of testing, prior to just launching it to your entire device estate.\nPKI authentication done, what about the Entra authentication?\nEntra Authentication Application # This process is going to look very familiar, but there some key differences, but the start is the same so go create a new Windows app (Win32) in Microsoft Intune, complete the App information page with the information needed after uploading the .intunewin file again.\nFor the Program page, we need to amend our install command to the below passing in the required parameters we covered earlier:\n\u0026#34;%systemroot%\\sysnative\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\u0026#34; -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.ps1 -ccmSiteCode \u0026#34;ENB\u0026#34; -ccmMP \u0026#34;https://configmgrmp.ennbee.local\u0026#34; -cmgAddress \u0026#34;CONFIGMGRCMG.CLOUDAPP.NET/CCM_Proxy_MutualAuth/72186325152220500\u0026#34; -tenantId \u0026#34;daf4a1c2-3a0c-401b-966f-0b855d3abd1a\u0026#34; -clientAppId \u0026#34;7506ee10-f7ec-415a-b415-cd3d58790d97\u0026#34; -clientAppURL \u0026#34;https://localhost\u0026#34; The uninstall command remains the same however:\ncmd.exe /c del %ProgramData%\\Microsoft\\CCMCMGInstall\\Install-ConfigMgrClientCMG.ps1.tag Program section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app for Entra authentication. As with the PKI authentication configuration we need to add our Entra requirement script, updating the output data type to String and value of Ready.\nRequirements section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app for Entra authentication. Same as with PKI authentication we need to create our Detection rule using the very same .tag file.\nDetection Rule section in Microsoft Intune for the Win32app for Entra authentication. Click Click Next OK-ing our way to the end, we now have both applications ready to be deployed to our orphaned Configuration Manager client devices.\nClient Installation # If you really want to double-down on getting this issue resolved, you can deploy both apps with the differing installation commands and requirements to the same Entra ID group, then regardless of whether they\u0026rsquo;ve got a valid certificate or they\u0026rsquo;re Entra joined, they\u0026rsquo;ll give the Configuration Manager client installation a good go.\nAs the detection method is the same for both apps, you\u0026rsquo;re not going to impact devices that have already run one or the other app.\nMicrosoft Intune Reporting # Giving Microsoft Intune a little while to catch up with the deployments, we should start seeing devices report back their installation status, and show any devices that are not meeting the requirements:\nA device failing the PKI requirements check in Microsoft Intune. With the same assignment group being used across both apps, we need to keep an eye out for devices that are failing both requirements checks. As well as devices that are actually reporting as installing the application:\nApp installation overview in Microsoft Intune. This isn\u0026rsquo;t the end of the story though, as Microsoft Intune is just telling us whether the client setup files are now on the targeted devices after meeting either the Entra Join or Client Certificate requirements.\nClient Installation Logs # Now we\u0026rsquo;ve assigned our new app to a group of devices that are no longer communicating with Configuration Manager, we can go and jump on a device targeted by the app, and keep an eye on the ccmsetup.log in C:\\Windows\\ccmsetup.\nWhat we\u0026rsquo;re looking for here, is the start of the installation passing through the parameters we configured in the PowerShell script we created:\nThe ccmsetup.log log file running the Configuration Manager client installation. You can now trail this log to make sure that the device is authenticating to the Cloud Management Gateway, and await for a final exit code of either 0, successful install or 7, pending restart, with both denote that the client has successfully installed, and communicated to Configuration Manager.\nSummary # This one might not have been the most conventional approach to Configuration Manager client installation, but the situation, as strange as it is, forced our hand to think of a non-standard way to push out the Configuration Manager client to these orphaned Windows devices to allow them to successfully phone home to the Configuration Manager Management Points using the Cloud Management Gateway without physically getting our hands on them.\nAt least with this method, and not just blindly pushing out the client without the requirements and installation arguments, means that devices are only going to start chatting to the Cloud Management Gateway when they can actually authenticate to it, regardless of which authentication method you\u0026rsquo;re using in your environment.\nThe status of your clients can be monitored in Configuration Manager Cloud management dashboard, as the app we pushed will start the ccmsetup process, authenticate to the Cloud Management Gateway, allowing them to check back in with Configuration Manager.\n","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/configmgr-client-install-cmg/","section":"Posts","summary":"You\u0026rsquo;ve just implemented a Cloud Management Gateway to help your hybrid joined Windows devices communicate to Configuration Manager over the internet, but what if they\u0026rsquo;re orphaned and unable to communicate to Configuration Manager to get the new Client Settings?","title":"Installing the Configuration Manager Client on Orphaned Internet Devices","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/configmgr/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Microsoft Configuration Manager","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PowerShell","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cis/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Center for Internet Security (CIS)","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"12 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/custom-profiles/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Custom Profiles","type":"tags"},{"content":"I currently work as a Technical Consultant in the Cloud Endpoint practice at Phoenix Software Ltd (who, in recognition for outstanding achievements, have been awarded Microsoft Partner of the Year for 2023), specialising in the deployment and management of Microsoft Intune, a pivotal tool for modern device management and application deployment.\nBeyond working with Microsoft Intune, I am passionate about PowerBI Reporting and PowerShell scripting.

Once created, select the trigger, and if required allow the connection to your Exchange Online calendar, the select the Calendar Id, you can then update the settings for how often to check for events:\nUpdating the trigger settings in the flow. Now we have a trigger that will monitor your Exchange Online calendar for events starting soon.

Within the value field select the Harry Potter looking lightning bolt , to use data from the trigger above, and search for Show as selecting it, and updating the condition to look like the below:\nAdding logic into the Condition action for Out of Office events. Which now means that when the trigger looks at events in the calendar, it has a decision to make when an event is marked as Out of Office.\nSetting a Private Status Condition # As I also like to take time off from work, I thought best we leverage the flow to not only set up an automatic reply when I\u0026rsquo;m working with a customer, but also when I am genuinely Out of the Office.\nTo make life easier for myself, I mark actual holidays in my calendar as Private, so we can use this additional flag on the calendar event and add another condition to the flow under the True section of the Condition we created previously.\nSame as before, select the little + sign under the True option, and select Add add an action searching again for Condition, this time after selecting Harry Potter, search for Sensitivity:\nAdding logic into the Condition action for Private events. Configure the logic to say that Sensitivity is equal to private, meaning that if the event discovered is both Out of Office and Private do something.\nNow onto the something.\nSetting the Out of Office for Holidays # For our holiday automatic reply, we\u0026rsquo;re working under the True section of the condition, select Add an action again, this time search for Set up automatic replies (V2):\nAdding an automatic reply under the True condition.

This will configure the Automatic Reply to start based on the start time of the event, and end when the event ends.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re not done quite yet, as we need to add in a message to send to people inside the organisation, and outside.\nLuckily the message supports HTML, so you make it look pretty, or you can just plonk in some basic information:\nItem Value Internal Reply Message I am currently sunning myself and have turned off my work emails, good luck have fun. External Reply Message I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your email until my return. Looking like the below in the flow:\nConfiguring automatic reply messages under the True condition.

So what\u0026rsquo;s the catch? Well you write a blog post about it\u0026hellip;duh.\n1. The Tool # First off, let\u0026rsquo;s look at the Migration Tool which I\u0026rsquo;m pretty sure we\u0026rsquo;ve all used in our time allowing the automatic creation of Firewall Rule policies, taking existing Group Policy applied rules from a target device and punting them straight into Microsoft Intune.\nOh it\u0026rsquo;s gone.\nWell Microsoft you are correct, the old version of the tool did create the old mdm Endpoint Security Profiles, and it did use the old authentication method, but it also did work.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re sensible nice enough to follow me on LinkedIn you might have spotted that as a favour to a stranger (not the first time mind you), I updated the migration tool to support the new authentication method, and a couple of other bits as well.\n2. The Script # I\u0026rsquo;m not using this post to break down exactly how I fixed updated the PowerShell script in the short term, but in summary I\u0026hellip;\nRemoved the reliance on the Microsoft GitHub repo to download content. Changed authentication to use the Microsoft.Graph PowerShell module. Changed the web requests to use Invoke-MgGraphRequest for calls to Graph. Forced the PowerShell script to create Endpoint Security templates for firewall rule policies instead of Configuration Profiles. Changed the Authentication to Graph to use device authentication as I\u0026rsquo;m a dirty macOS user. Disabled sending any telemetry data on success and failure of rule creation to Microsoft, as they have too much data on me already. Fixed an issue when checking for profile name matching when there are no existing firewall rule policies in Microsoft Intune. To use the script itself, you:\nDownload the FirewallRuleMigration.zip file and extract on your Windows device. Open PowerShell as Administrator. Navigate to the extracted folder, your PowerShell prompt should be in the FirewallRuleMigration folder. Run Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass accepting all prompts like a good little child. Run ./Export-FirewallRules.ps1 with the corresponding switches (includeDisabledRules, includeLocalRules) if required. Authenticate to Graph using a Global Admin account, twice*. Enter a new profile name for the Firewall rules policy when prompted. Wait for rules to be uploaded to Microsoft Intune. *The script will disconnect all existing Graph sessions, and connect twice; once to allow for consent to be provided, the following to allow the script to run following the consent request.\nSo with this new script in hand, you can still migrate your Group Policy applied Firewall rules to Microsoft Intune, nice eh?\n3. Firewall Rules 2: The Conversioning # What I did not expect when running the PowerShell script, and after it created the Firewall Rule policies in Microsoft Intune, were them to just change.\nWhat I expected, is that I\u0026rsquo;d have to use my old script to actually convert them from the old versions\u0026hellip;\nFirewall Rule Policies created using the Migration Tool. \u0026hellip;and not just wait ten minutes for them to transition to new rules.\nFirewall Rule Policies converted using Microsoft secret sauce. So wtf is happening?\nNo clue.\n4. Are Microsoft Magicians? # Yes.\n5. The Truthening # The original Firewall Rule policies created by my wonderful PowerShell script are still using the legacy templates in Microsoft Intune:\nFirewall Rule Policies the old worse way of dealing with them. And to prove I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend my evening somehow manually creating 150 firewall rules in a way you can no longer create them, you can see the audit log showing that the policies were created at the timestamp:\nDefinitely real and not made up Microsoft Intune audit log. But oh what have we found here with our super secret snooping skills?\nClicking on one of the items that were created by the PowerShell script, we get a bit more detail:\nStill a real and not made up Microsoft Intune audit log but with more detail. But what\u0026rsquo;s this at the bottom of the entry:\nOMG it\u0026rsquo;s migrating. Zoom and enhance. Yeah this means nothing.\nThe audit log is showing that a new legacy Firewall Rule policy is being created, how do we know? Well it\u0026rsquo;s still using the old Endpoint Security templateId value of 4356d05c-a4ab-4a07-9ece-739f7c792910.\nAnother screenshot of some audit stuff. Running a quick Graph Explorer GET request to:\nhttps://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/templates?`$filter=(isof(%27microsoft.graph.securityBaselineTemplate%27)) and you\u0026rsquo;ll see all the Endpoint Security Templates, and specifically this one:\n{ \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.securityBaselineTemplate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4356d05c-a4ab-4a07-9ece-739f7c792910\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Windows Firewall rules\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Windows Firewall allows administrators to define granular Firewall rules.

Devices getting the setting BlockNonAdminUserInstall set to enabled, causes issues with the Photos app on the device for devices running the April 2024 patch.\nCIS (L1) Level 1 Misc - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Name OMA-URI Data Type Value BlockNonAdminUserInstall ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/ApplicationManagement/BlockNonAdminUserInstall Integer 1 We also can\u0026rsquo;t blame CIS for both AllowWindowsConsumerFeatures and BlockNonAdminUserInstall failing to apply to devices either, as due to the June 2024 patch devices which should be activated to Windows 11 Enterprise as part of subscription activation, don\u0026rsquo;t, leaving devices at their original Windows edition, in this case Windows Pro.\nCIS Level 1 Miscellaneous setting custom profile assignment error. Meaning that neither AllowWindowsConsumerFeatures and BlockNonAdminUserInstall will apply to non-Enterprise editions of Windows:\nPolicyCSP Edition settings for BlockNonAdminUserInstall Are there any other settings in the benchmark require specific Windows editions?\nWindows Edition Requirements # The Windows subscription activation issues, and subsequent edition downgrade, highlighted something I hadn\u0026rsquo;t considered, just how many settings in the CIS 3.0.1 benchmark for Level 1 actually require an Enterprise or Education editions of Windows, or at least just don\u0026rsquo;t work on Pro editions?\nWell I\u0026rsquo;m not going to count them for you (I actually did, it\u0026rsquo;s seven).\nSetting Profile AllowWindowsConsumerFeatures CIS (L1) Level 1 Misc - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 BlockNonAdminUserInstall CIS (L1) Level 1 Misc - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Allow Spotlight Collection (User) CIS (L1) Section 22 - 80 (User) - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Disable Consumer Account State Content CIS (L1) Section 22 - 80 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Require Private Store Only CIS (L1) Section 22 - 80 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Credential Guard CIS (L1) Virtualization Based Technology - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Require Platform Security Features CIS (L1) Virtualization Based Technology - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 If you\u0026rsquo;ve only got devices running Windows Professional, you can say goodbye to blocking the Windows Consumer Features, or by requiring the Windows Private Store, blocking access to the store itself, or worse, device security settings in Credential Guard and Secure Boot not applying.\nSettings that require Windows Enterprise editions to apply to a device. So this leaves a bit of a gap in the Level 1 benchmark for these Windows Professional cloud native devices, or does it?\nWell no, we just can\u0026rsquo;t use Microsoft Intune native settings to configure them. What we can do is use our favourite tooling Group Policy, PowerShell, to go and set some corresponding registry settings to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re in-line with the benchmark.\nWe can create a PowerShell script to create the six, (yes I said six), registry settings. These exist in the HKLM registry hive, so we can happily update them using a PowerShell and a Platform Script in Microsoft Intune.\nCIS (L1) Windows Pro Settings - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1.ps1 # Windows Pro Device Settings $regSettings = @() $regSettings += [pscustomobject]@{path = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CloudContent\u0026#39;; name = \u0026#39;DisableWindowsConsumerFeatures\u0026#39;; value = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; type = \u0026#39;DWord\u0026#39; } $regSettings += [pscustomobject]@{path = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CloudContent\u0026#39;; name = \u0026#39;DisableConsumerAccountStateContent\u0026#39;; value = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; type = \u0026#39;DWord\u0026#39; } $regSettings += [pscustomobject]@{path = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx\u0026#39;; name = \u0026#39;BlockNonAdminUserInstall\u0026#39;; value = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; type = \u0026#39;DWord\u0026#39; } $regSettings += [pscustomobject]@{path = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsStore\u0026#39;; name = \u0026#39;RequirePrivateStoreOnly\u0026#39;; value = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; type = \u0026#39;DWord\u0026#39; } $regSettings += [pscustomobject]@{path = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\u0026#39;; name = \u0026#39;LsaCfgFlags\u0026#39;; value = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; type = \u0026#39;DWord\u0026#39; } $regSettings += [pscustomobject]@{path = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard\u0026#39;; name = \u0026#39;RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures\u0026#39;; value = \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;; type = \u0026#39;DWord\u0026#39; } Try { foreach ($regSetting in $regSettings) { if (!(Test-Path $($regSetting.path))){ New-Item -Path $($regSetting.path) -Force } New-ItemProperty -Path $($regSetting.path) -Name $($regSetting.name) -Value $($regSetting.value) -PropertyType $($regSetting.type) -Force } Exit 0 } Catch { Write-Error $_.ErrorDetails Exit 1 } Sadly, the Allow Spotlight Collection setting, only exists in the HKCU part of the registry, and sits under the HKCU:\\Software\\Policies key which standard users don\u0026rsquo;t have access to write to. So we don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to create this new item using PowerShell and Platform Scripts natively.\nJonathan has informed me that you could apply the Allow Spotlight Collection setting in HKCU using the PSAppDeployToolkit, specifically the Invoke-HKCURegistrySettingsForAllUsers functionality, so off you trot and do that. The rest of registry entries in CIS (L1) Windows Pro Settings - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1.ps1 are fine, so deploy them to your devices using a Platform Script:\nPlatform Script configuring Windows Enterprise only Policy CSP Settings. Using Platform Scripts, we\u0026rsquo;re currently limited to assignments without Device Filters, so we don\u0026rsquo;t have a way to target just Windows devices that aren\u0026rsquo;t on Windows 11 Enterprise/Education (operating system edition isn\u0026rsquo;t an attribute stored in the Entra ID computer object, so no Dynamic Groups either).\nSeeing the script do it\u0026rsquo;s thing, we now have the configured registry settings, (at least those in HKLM), set on the device, with the expected behaviour of the CIS benchmark:\nWindows Pro registry settings under HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CloudContent. Windows Pro registry settings under HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Appx. Windows Pro registry settings under HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsStore. Windows Pro registry settings under HKLM:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DeviceGuard. The CIS (L1) Windows Pro Settings - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1.ps1 PowerShell scripts should be added as Platform scripts in Microsoft Intune. User Settings # Any other assignment issues you want to throw our way and not document CIS? No? Are you sure?\nHaving reviewed the device assignment states after by default assigning the imported build kit settings to groups of devices in Microsoft Intune, I was left pondering as to why CIS wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mention that there are User only settings in each of the profiles.\nUser Only settings not applying to the device context in Microsoft Intune. This isn\u0026rsquo;t such a bad thing, as you\u0026rsquo;re just going to get a Not Applicable state when assigned to the SYSTEM context of the device, the user on the device will be fine though.\nHowever, for good practice assignment, we should split out the user settings from the profiles, and create new ones, allowing a consistent assignment of settings.\nCIS (L1) Admin Templates - Windows Components (User) - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Administrative Templates \u0026gt; Windows Components \u0026gt; Network Sharing Prevent users from sharing files within their profile.

CIS Level 1 Settings # Now hopefully we\u0026rsquo;re done with settings in the Level 1 benchmark that just don\u0026rsquo;t work properly, we can look at settings that are missing, or settings that are just going to annoy your end-users or support teams 🫠.\nLocal Administrator Password Solution # On to recommendations that exist in the Benchmark document but not in the build kit, we can start with Windows LAPS.\nThe Windows LAPS settings don\u0026rsquo;t exist in the build kit as it\u0026rsquo;s configured under Account Protection in the Endpoint Security section of Microsoft Intune, so I assume CIS just didn\u0026rsquo;t include it as there is no native import functionality.\nTaking the information provided in the benchmark document, we need to cover off everything under section 85 Windows LAPS, as they\u0026rsquo;re all CIS Level 1 settings.\nAn excerpt from the CIS 3.0.1 benchmark for Windows LAPS. We can easily create a new Account Protection policy in Microsoft Intune to meet these requirements, with the settings below:\nCIS (L1) Windows LAPS - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value LAPS Backup Directory Backup the password to Azure AD only LAPS Password Age Days 30 or fewer* LAPS Administrator Account Name Admin LAPS Password Complexity Large letters + small letters + numbers + special characters (improved readability) LAPS Password Length 15 or more* LAPS Post Authentication Actions Reset the password and logoff the managed account (or higher)* LAPS Post Authentication Reset Delay 8 (or fewer hours, but not 0)* *These are the minimum settings to adhere to the CIS benchmark, so amend as you see fit.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t forget if you are going to use Windows LAPS, that you enable the feature in Entra ID, and review the requirements to allow you to actually use it on your Windows 11 devices. The CIS (L1) Local Policies Security Options - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 CIS policy sets the built-in administrator account name to Admin, so make sure either you update the setting below in the imported policy to match any changes to the LAPS setting, or be happy with what it\u0026rsquo;s called:\nCIS (L1) Local Policies Security Options - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Local Policies Security Options Accounts Rename Administrator Account Admin We can\u0026rsquo;t export a Endpoint Security profile, even if they\u0026rsquo;re technically Settings Catalog profiles, so we\u0026rsquo;re using the Intune Management tool, allowing you to import the CIS (L1) Windows LAPS - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 profile instead of having to create it. Windows Updates and Delivery Optimisation # Is it all good in the world of Windows Update for Business settings in the CIS benchmark? Well kind of, if you want all of your devices to install updates every day, with no phasing, and just blindly update to the latest Feature Update after 180 days.\nCIS (L1) Windows Update - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Windows Update For Business Defer Feature Updates Period In Days 180 Windows Update For Business Defer Quality Updates Period (Days) 0 Windows Update For Business Scheduled Install Day Every day It\u0026rsquo;s not like there\u0026rsquo;s even much room for manoeuvre; the Feature Update deferral is a minimum of 180 days, so you could phase the delivery of Feature Updates at least, but the Quality Update deferral can only be zero days, so out goes the window for any kind of phasing.\nMaybe CIS has more faith in Windows Updates not breaking devices than others 🫢.\nAt least there\u0026rsquo;s a setting in the build kit for Delivery Optimisation, so all our devices installing Quality and Feature updates at the same time don\u0026rsquo;t smash the WAN connection to bits\u0026hellip;\nCIS (L1) Section 22 - 80 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Delivery Optimization DO Download Mode HTTP only, no peering Oh.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s OK, we can have any of the settings available to us in Microsoft Intune, just not HTTP blended with Internet peering.\nSection 22.1 (L1) Ensure \u0026lsquo;DO Download Mode\u0026rsquo; is NOT set to \u0026lsquo;HTTP blended with Internet Peering\u0026rsquo;. Just goes to show that you do really need to read the associated CIS Benchmark document along with using the build kit, or just take the word of someone on the internet that things work 😬.\nMicrosoft Store # As mentioned previously, having a Microsoft Intune setting to Require Private Store Only is only a Windows Enterprise edition feature, however we sorted that with the PowerShell script, so now that the setting is applying to all devices correctly, it blocks the store.\nCIS (L1) Section 22 - 80 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Microsoft App Store Require Private Store Only Only Private store is enabled. As there isn\u0026rsquo;t such as thing as a Private Store now the the Microsoft Store for Business has been retired (has it?), then the outcome of the setting above just blocks access to the store.\nThe Microsoft Store blocked by the Require Private Store setting in Microsoft Intune. In the same profile though at least the store apps are being kept up to date:\nCIS (L1) Section 22 - 80 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Microsoft App Store Allow apps from the Microsoft app store to auto update Allowed. But with no way easy way to check that apps are actually being updated, you\u0026rsquo;d better look at another option to ensure the built-in apps are kept up to date 😉.\nWindows Defender # You\u0026rsquo;d think there\u0026rsquo;d be nothing majorly wrong with the Windows Defender settings in the build kit, or the benchmark document itself, and on first glance all looks well apart from the lack of any kind remediations to quarantine or delete detected threats.\nYou might not be using Windows Defender as your primary antivirus solution, so CIS not assuming you are is a good thing.\nBut based on this, CIS wouldn\u0026rsquo;t include anything in the imported profiles that does require Windows Defender to be acting a as primary solution and/or in active mode though?\nCIS (L1) Defender - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Defender Block executable content from email client and webmail Block Defender Block Office applications from injecting code into other processes Block Defender Block Office applications from creating executable content Block Defender Block abuse of exploited vulnerable signed drivers (Device) Block Defender Block persistence through WMI event subscription Block Defender Block untrusted and unsigned processes that run from USB Block Defender Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content Block Defender Block credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem Block Defender Block Adobe Reader from creating child processes Block Defender Block all Office applications from creating child processes Block Defender Block Office communication application from creating child processes Block Defender Block Win32 API calls from Office macros Block Defender Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts Block Ah, 13 Attack Surface Reduction Rules, and all in block mode , not an audit setting in sight. Brilliant.\nSo even if you do meet the dependencies below for the ASR rules to actually apply, they\u0026rsquo;re all going to straight up block everything they find that matches the rules.\nMicrosoft Defender Antivirus must be enabled and configured as primary anti-virus solution, and must be in the following mode:\nPrimary antivirus/antimalware solution State: Active mode Which is another good reason to actually check to see what these build kit profiles are configuring, without blindly applying them to you device estate and being all surprised when stuff stops working.\nWindows System Services # CIS provide a PowerShell script as part of the Level 1 benchmark to disable some scary looking Windows System Services, specifically the below (even if the Xbox ones are already disabled by CIS (L1) System Services - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1).\nThe table below details the apparent effect of disabling these services.\nService Name Service Description Impact Browser Computer Browser No more discovery of network devices. IISADMIN IIS Admin Service No SMTP or FTP configuration in IIS. irmon Infrared monitor service No transfer of data using Infrared. SharedAccess Internet Connection Sharing No sharing of network connections, bye bye Hyper-V bridging. LxssManager LxssManager Bye bye Windows Subsystem for Linux. FTPSVC Microsoft FTP Service Clearly no more FTP servers. sshd OpenSSH SSH Server Same as above but SSH servers. RpcLocator Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator Nowt, legacy service. RemoteAccess Routing and Remote Access As on the tin, used for RRAS servers. simptcp Simple TCP/IP LocalServices$LocalServices Apparently has little use in modern environments, and is an optional Windows feature. sacsvr Special Administration Console Helper Remote command prompt used as part of Windows Emergency Management Services and Serial Console. SSDPSRV SSDP Discovery UPnP device discovery is now dead. upnphost UPnP Device Host UPnP device discovery is still dead. WMSvc Web Management Service No more management of local web servers. WMPNetworkSvc Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service No media sharing from Windows Media Player. icssvc Windows Mobile Hotspot Service No creation of Mobile hotspots. W3SVC World Wide Web Publishing Service No more local web servers. XboxGipSvc Xbox Accessory Management Service No playing games. XblAuthManager Xbox Live Auth Manager No logging into games. XblGameSave Xbox Live Game Save No saving games. XboxNetApiSvc Xbox Live Networking Service No games. So happy with all the functionality that is being prevented, we can deploy the provided script using Microsoft Intune Platform Scripts with deployment settings looking something like this:\nCIS Level 1 services PowerShell Script in Microsoft Intune. The PowerShell Script CIS (L1) System Services - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 is available to download and add as a new Platform Script to Microsoft Intune.

Ensuring you set a suitable schedule for the remediation to run, daily is probably overkill, just make sure it\u0026rsquo;s running before any kind of CIS audit 😂.\nThe CIS (L1) System Services - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 detection and remediation scripts are available for your to add into your Microsoft Intune tenant. Summary # What I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt looking over the CIS Level 1 settings, is that there are some pretty large gaps in the build kit; settings that just don\u0026rsquo;t exist such as with Windows LAPS, settings that only apply to users and not devices, settings that only apply to specific editions of Windows, minimum settings that will cause unexpected behaviour, and some normal good practice settings for security solutions such as Windows Defender that are just plain missing.\nThis does mean though, that applying a CIS benchmark is only part of the story when it comes to securing your Windows 11 cloud native devices, and it\u0026rsquo;s worth looking into other Security Baselines (cough Microsoft cough) to help harden not only the operating system, but applications that reside on top.\nNext up is the final part in the series, the dreaded CIS Level 2 settings, surely it can\u0026rsquo;t get any worse?\n","date":"15 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-cis-patching-gaps-part3/","section":"Posts","summary":"The impact of the CIS settings on BitLocker and Windows Autopilot now done and dusted, we should broaden our horizons and start to look at what other problems the CIS level 1 benchmark brings to Windows 11 as a whole.

We can create a new Custom Profile in Microsoft Intune with the below setting, allowing for the device to have a more suitable name:\nWindows Autopilot v2 - Device Rename Name OMA-URI Data Type Value DNSComputerName ./DevDetail/Ext/Microsoft/DNSComputerName String ENB-%SERIAL% Device named, how do we make it stick, and by this, I mean how do we force a restart?\nForcing the Restart # Well we can cheat, well we use the fact that there are some known issues with specific Security settings and their impact to Windows Autopilot causing device restarts, which we have looked at before.\nPatching Gaps in the CIS Windows 11 Benchmark - Level 1 Windows Autopilot 23 June 2024\u0026middot; loading Microsoft Intune Windows 10 and later Security Center for Internet Security (CIS) Windows Autopilot Windows Hello Settings Catalog PowerShell With the CIS BitLocker and associated DMA settings reviewed and updated, now is time to delve into the Windows 11 specific settings that exist in the CIS Level 1 benchmark. What issues do they bring to Windows Autopilot, what solutions can we find? Honestly, who knows. So picking at least one of the settings from the Policy CSP for Device Guard, (which you should be applying to your Windows 11 devices anyway), we can look to force a restart as part of the application of the Custom Profile containing our device name settings:\nWindows Autopilot v2 - Device Rename Name OMA-URI Data Type Value DNSComputerName ./DevDetail/Ext/Microsoft/DNSComputerName String ENB-%SERIAL% EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/DeviceGuard/EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity Integer 1 I picked EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity but you can select any in the document, they all cause some type of restart during OOBE. Making sure to assign this new profile to the same group of devices used in your APDP (is this really any better than APv2?) policy:\nWindows Autopilot Device Preparation Policy device group assignment. If you like screenshots of Microsoft Intune, here\u0026rsquo;s another one for you, this time of the Custom Profile:\nWindows Autopilot Device Preparation rename policy assignment. Renaming in Action # You can see this rename process in action, and the device restart, following all the other OOBE gumph which I\u0026rsquo;ve kindly sped up:\nAlthough the device itself is now happily renamed, Microsoft Intune is being a little whinge about the assignment of the profile:\nProfile assignment errors in Microsoft Intune for DNSComputerName. Yeah, errors, and not ones we can do anything about either, but at least the device got renamed right? Nowt to complain about here. Jog on.\nSummary # There you have it, another way to rename shiny new APDP devices (stop trying to make \u0026ldquo;APDP\u0026rdquo; happen), but honestly, I\u0026rsquo;m almost done caring about device names at this point.\nThe whole Autopilot Deployment Device Preparation process is user centric, what exactly are you using device names for? Applying settings to specific dynamic security groups based on device name?\nI mean this is a bad idea right, firstly APDP (I\u0026rsquo;m still trying, leave me alone.) hands you a group of devices which you can use, secondly, if you\u0026rsquo;re applying settings to devices based on something trivial like the device name, what\u0026rsquo;s stopping an Administrative user changing the device name and circumventing your policies? Literally nothing.\nSo instead of complaining that there are missing features with APDP (last time I promise), like renaming devices, or lack of other deployment methods, or that it takes longer than normal, or there\u0026rsquo;s more user interaction, can we just all move on and find other better ways of grouping devices, you know like with Device Filters and User assignments.\n","date":"2 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-autopilot-v2-renaming/","section":"Posts","summary":"So Microsoft released Windows Autopilot Device Preparation, or more commonly known as APv2, into General Availability a little while ago.

We did already know about the AutoAdminLogon setting causing the issue with Windows Autopilot, as it is documented, but who has time to read all of these articles 😂.\nBut how do we stop this from breaking Autopilot exactly?\nAs pointed out in the comments, the Policy CSP documentation is a little vague around supported operating system versions, so we\u0026rsquo;ve found an alternative way to meet this requirement without breaking Windows Autopilot deployments. Instead of attempting to using Microsoft Intune native configuration, we can lean on the registry setting to configure this CIS level 1 requirement:\nAutoAdminLogon registry setting reference. To ensure it doesn\u0026rsquo;t break anything, we can deploy a remediation script to set the registry value, assigning the script to users, meaning that it won\u0026rsquo;t apply until after the Autopilot process has completed.\nThe detection script will look for the AutoAdminLogon string value, and if it does not exist, or it is not set to 0 will report an error:\nCIS (L1) Section 3.5.1 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1_Detection.ps1 Try { $registry = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\u0026#39; $setting = \u0026#39;AutoAdminLogon\u0026#39; # Checks if the key and if the string value AutoAdminLogon exists Try { $value = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path $registry -Name $setting } Catch { Write-Warning \u0026#34;$setting not configured.\u0026#34; Exit 1 } # if the key and dword exist checks the value. if ($value -ne \u0026#39;0\u0026#39;) { Write-Warning \u0026#34;$setting enabled.\u0026#34; Exit 1 } else { Write-Output \u0026#34;$setting disabled.\u0026#34; Exit 0 } } Catch { Write-Error $_.Exception Exit 2000 } With the remediation configured to create the AutoAdminLogon if required, and set it to 0, to disable this option:\nCIS (L1) Section 3.5.1 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1_Remediation.ps1 Try { $registry = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\u0026#39; $setting = \u0026#39;AutoAdminLogon\u0026#39; $path = Test-Path $registry # checks if the key exists, if not creates the key and AutoAdminLogon string. if ($path -eq $false) { New-Item -Path $registry -Force | Out-Null New-ItemProperty -Path $registry -Name $setting -Value 0 -PropertyType String -Force | Out-Null Write-Output \u0026#34;$setting disabled.\u0026#34; Exit 0 } else { # checks if the AutoAdminLogon string exists, if not creates it.

Saving changing this across all devices, as it only impacts Windows Autopilot devices, you can remove this setting from the benchmark profiles, and create a new policy with the below settings:\nCIS (L1) Section 3.10.25.2 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Administrative Templates \u0026gt; System \u0026gt; Logon Do not display network selection UI Disabled Then assign it to your corporate devices, excluding Dynamic Security Groups containing Windows Autopilot Devices where their profile allows the use of pre-provisioning as in the Interactive Logon Messages section.\nThis will enable these devices, and these only, to select a new network not previously connected to, before logging onto their device, which if they\u0026rsquo;ve been deployed somewhere other than the current location, means they can actually sign in 😆.\nDespite this only being one setting to create, we\u0026rsquo;ve been nice and made the CIS (L1) Section 3.10.25.2 - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 profile available for you to import, along with the amended original profile CIS (L1) Admin Templates - System - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1. Windows Hello for Business # Now Windows Hello for Business isn\u0026rsquo;t strictly a Windows Autopilot thing, but if you\u0026rsquo;re deploying a Windows Hello for Business policy to either your users or devices, then they\u0026rsquo;re going to get prompted to configure Windows Hello when they sign in.\nSo we were happy to see the use of Windows Hello for Business as an authentication method, to add multi-factor authentication to Windows 11 accounts, recommend by CIS 🎉.\nCIS (L1) Device Lock \u0026amp; WHFB - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Windows Hello For Business Minimum PIN Length 6 Windows Hello For Business Require Security Device true Windows Hello For Business Facial Features Use Enhanced Anti Spoofing true You haven\u0026rsquo;t configured additional settings somewhere else that will impact the use of Windows Hello have you CIS?\nAccount options in Windows 11 unable to configure Windows Hello PIN.

It can then be deployed to your Windows Autopilot devices using a Platform Script in Microsoft Intune in conjunction with the supplemental policy we created, with the below settings:\nBitLocker Platform script settings in Microsoft Intune. Using a Platform script over a remediation script allows this to be run (maybe) during Windows Autopilot, or if you\u0026rsquo;re fancy and using the new Windows Autopilot device preparation method, actually guarantee that it runs during the deployment.\nFor our test Windows Autopilot device with the inventive serial number qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm, set using Advanced Settings Editor for Hyper-V Virtual Machines and by running a hand across a keyboard\u0026hellip;\nWindows Autopilot device serial number. We can see that after restarting during Windows Autopilot (forced by another CIS setting, but more on that another time), the device is now asking for a BitLocker PIN, and low and behold it\u0026rsquo;s the first 14-characters of the device serial number in uppercase:\nAfter deploying the PowerShell script, remember to tell your end users what their BitLocker PIN is, and get them to change it themselves within Windows after the Windows Autopilot deployment has completed.\nThe CIS (BL) BitLocker TPMandPIN - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1.ps1 PowerShell script should be added to a Platform script in Microsoft Intune, but feel free to test it manually first. Thunderbolt DMA Protection # We\u0026rsquo;ve looked at DMA (Direct Memory Access) settings previously, but looking at exceptions to security hardening not the implementation of them, but we\u0026rsquo;re familiar with what they are at least.\nThe settings in the CIS profile basically reduce two threat types to BitLocker; what it actually does from an end user experience perspective, is stop peripherals connected to a dock using a Thunderbolt port connection to a Windows device from being used prior to logon.\nCIS (BL) BitLocker - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Administrative Templates \u0026gt; System \u0026gt; Device Installation \u0026gt; Device Installation Restrictions Prevent installation of devices that match any of these device IDs Enabled Administrative Templates \u0026gt; System \u0026gt; Device Installation \u0026gt; Device Installation Restrictions Also apply to matching devices that are already installed.

Systems that are left in the Standby power state. Systems that use the TPM-only BitLocker protector. We can\u0026rsquo;t do much about devices that are left turned on sadly, short of powering down systems programmatically, which isn\u0026rsquo;t going to please anyone, so these DMA settings are going to have to stay exactly as they are.\nMiscellaneous Settings # So this won\u0026rsquo;t be the first example of where it\u0026rsquo;s important to review the benchmark documentation and not just use the build kit, as there are additional BitLocker settings under section 86.1.4 (BL) Ensure \u0026lsquo;Enumeration policy for external devices incompatible with Kernel DMA Protection\u0026rsquo; is set to \u0026lsquo;Enabled: Block All\u0026rsquo; surrounding device enumeration policies and more DMA protection:\nExtract of the CIS 3.0.1 benchmark for BitLocker section 86.1.4 This setting now exists within Settings Catalog, so we no longer need a Custom Profile, as pointed out in the CIS Intune community (which we have finally joined 😅) To meet these additional requirements, we did need to configure a new Custom Profile, in Microsoft Intune to align to the DeviceEnumerationPolicy recommendation in the benchmark, but now we can just use a Settings Catalog profile instead.\nCIS (BL) BitLocker Misc - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 Category Setting Value Dma Guard Device Enumeration Policy Block all (Most restrictive) Which was created based on the details in the Policy CSP article. This is another device impact setting, adding to the Thunderbolt DMA protection settings, and stopping DMA capable devices that cannot be sandboxed, remapped, or isolated in memory.\nBe cautious though, as this policy setting does require a restart, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t force one.\nYou can now import the CIS (BL) BitLocker Misc - Windows 11 Intune 3.0.1 into your Microsoft Intune tenant instead of having to use a Custom profile. Summary # So that\u0026rsquo;s all there is to the CIS benchmark for Windows 11 BitLocker security in Microsoft Intune, pretty simple really 😅.\nWe hope you now have a good grasp on exactly what the benchmark and policy settings are doing regarding BitLocker and the security around it, why the policies are applying these settings, and importantly how to improve and work with the restrictions to make not only the implementation in Microsoft Intune more straight forward, but also the end-user experience.\nThis saves you just implementing the benchmark build kit settings in Microsoft Intune and being all when your devices don\u0026rsquo;t just encrypt themselves, or your keyboards connected to docks don\u0026rsquo;t work at the sign-in screen.\nNext up for us in the series are the CIS Level 1 settings, and if you thought the BitLocker settings were painful, you\u0026rsquo;re in for a shock 😆.\n","date":"15 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-cis-patching-gaps-part1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Everyone loves a security benchmark, and with the imminent move to Windows 11 for everyone, the Center for Internet Security released version 3.0.1 of theirs, including a build kit for Microsoft Intune, but what does this build kit break for BitLocker encryption?","title":"Patching Gaps in the CIS Windows 11 Benchmark - BitLocker","type":"posts"},{"content":"I don\u0026rsquo;t usually write \u0026ldquo;how-to\u0026rdquo; guides, let alone write topics that aren\u0026rsquo;t deeply embedded with Microsoft Intune or PowerShell, but I recently hit an issue when trying to setup a Windows Autopilot ARM based virtual machine using UTM on my Apple Silicon (humble brag) based macOS device.\nWith the recent announcement of the next generation of Windows Autopilot and Windows Autopilot device preparation now being official, I imagine there are now more and more people that are using macOS devices but need to test Windows Autopilot in a Virtual Machine, and thought, here\u0026rsquo;s an easy on trend blog post, that I should share the solution to the issue I encountered.\nAs always though, before you go and jump to how I fixed the problem, you should probably read the entire post to get a full picture of the scenario.\nWindows Virtualisation # As I spent all my pocket money on a MacBook Air M1, I\u0026rsquo;ve got none left to pay for virtualisation apps, so I use UTM; I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s also a lot better to use than others out there, and supports virtualising many operating systems natively without emulation, including Windows 11 ARM versions.\nSo if you\u0026rsquo;re not using UTM, go and download it from the website, or install it using Homebrew if you\u0026rsquo;re that way inclined:\nbrew install utm Before we go and setup a new Virtual Machine, we need to get the Windows 11 installation media, otherwise we\u0026rsquo;re not going to make any progress.\nWindows Installation Images # To make life a lot easier when downloading the supported iso files for Windows 11 ARM, I\u0026rsquo;d suggest installing CrystalFetch. This gives a user interface to downloading the Windows installation image, without having to build them yourself.\nYou can download CrystalFetch either from the App Store, or again install it with Homebrew:\nbrew install crystalfetch Once you\u0026rsquo;ve installed CrystalFetch, launch it and kick off the download of the version of Windows 11 you want:\nCrystalFetch preparing to download Windows 11 ARM en-gb. I had success with the en-gb variant of the Windows 11 ARM iso, the en-us just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to complete the download and build. Now that we have our installation media downloaded, we can go setup a new Virtual Machine in UTM.\nVirtual Machine Setup # Opening UTM, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to select Create a New Virtual Machine, then following along with the video below to configure it:\nNow that we have our Virtual Machine configured, time to power it on and install Windows.\nCheck me out recording videos instead of screen-shotting everything a thousand times\u0026hellip;for those interested I use Kap. Windows 11 Installation # After starting the machine, smush the keyboard when prompted to boot from the iso that we attached during the setup, we should have all at least installed Windows 11 once before, but watch the video if you need a refresh.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re not bothering with a product key, as a) I cba typing one out, and b) we can just use Microsoft Intune or Subscription Activation to sort out keys and the license later on.\nMake sure that you do actually have a way to apply a license otherwise big bad Microsoft will be knocking at your door asking you to pony up some cash. Windows Autopilot Preparation # With our newly built Windows 11 ARM Virtual Machine now available and booted, for the original Autopilot deployment configuration we still need to capture the hardware hash from the device and upload this to Microsoft Intune.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a great fan of the work Michael Niehaus has done to improve the Windows Autopilot process overall, so we\u0026rsquo;re using a PowerShell script based on his initial version to get the hardware hash.\nHardware Hash ID # We can start this capture process by running the below commands after launching a CMD prompt using Shift+F10 on the keyboard:\nRun powershell from the CMD prompt. Run Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass to allow the installation of scripts. Run Install-Script Get-WindowsAutopilotInfoCommunity and accept all prompts. Run Get-WindowsAutopilotInfoCommunity.ps1 -Online to capture the hardware hash, authenticate to Microsoft Entra, and upload the hardware hash to Microsoft Intune. If you want a break down of the script, check out this post. You can see the overall process in the video below:\nNow after we\u0026rsquo;ve authenticated to Microsoft Entra, there appears to be an issue\u0026hellip;PowerShell you\u0026rsquo;ve got red on you.\nFailing to get the hardware hash from the device. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to be a genius here to see that the error given relates to a lack of serialNumber on the virtual machine itself, which is required to build the hardware hash value that we need to add the device to Microsoft Intune as an Autopilot device.\nSo what gives?\nAdding a Serial Number # Well sadly our Virtual Machine is missing a serial number, it can\u0026rsquo;t pull a rogue one through from the macOS host like it would using Hyper-V on a Windows host, and UTM isn\u0026rsquo;t giving it one. So I guess we need to sort this out ourselves.\nAs UTM is built upon QEMU we have the ability to pass through QEMU parameters to the Virtual Machine, one of which gives us the option to configure a serial number. Wonderful.\nGo ahead and gracefully shutdown your Windows Virtual Machine, and right click and select edit in UTM:\nUTM Virtual Machine edit menu. Then navigate to QEMU \u0026gt; Arguments:\nUTM Virtual Machine QEMU parameters. Selecting New we can add in the following line:\n-smbios Followed by selecting New again, to add in the below where XXXXXXXX is the value of a serial number:\ntype=1,serial=XXXXXXXX I use this site to generate a random one. So for example:\ntype=1,serial=DNuesTLjtKit Which should look like the below in the parameters:\nSerial number parameters in the QEMU parameter settings in the Virtual Machine. Select Save, which on the screenshot is the button next to Cancel but for whatever reason in dark mode you can\u0026rsquo;t see the text.\nWindows Autopilot Deployment # Now we\u0026rsquo;ve added in the required serial number, go ahead and power on the Virtual Machine and we\u0026rsquo;ll try the capture again.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;ve already installed the required modules and set the PowerShell execution policy, we just need to launch the CMD prompt again using Shift+F10, running the below commands:\nRun powershell from the CMD prompt. Run Get-WindowsAutopilotInfoCommunity.ps1 -Online There are other parameters you can use with this script, but we\u0026rsquo;ll keep it simple for now. If you\u0026rsquo;ve done all this in good time, your original authentication token will still be valid, if not you will be prompted to authenticate to Entra again, either way the script should happily run and capture the hardware hash:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t record audio with the video so just hum some royalty free music to yourself. We can see now that as the device has a serial number, the PowerShell script can successfully capture the hardware hash and upload this to Microsoft Intune:\nCompleted synchronisation of a new Windows Autopilot device. We can check the progress of the upload in Microsoft Intune, so navigate to Devices \u0026gt; Enrollment and under the Windows Autopilot heading select Devices, and we should now see our newly uploaded device:\nWindows Autopilot Devices in Microsoft Intune. We could have assigned a Group Tag as part of the PowerShell script using:\nGet-WindowsAutopilotInfoCommunity.ps1 -Online -GroupTag Entra But I didn\u0026rsquo;t, so assigning that Group Tag now will allow for a Deployment Profile to be assigned:\nWindows Autopilot devices with Group Tag and profile assigned in Microsoft Intune. We can now restart our Windows 11 device, and low and behold it\u0026rsquo;s ready to start the Windows Autopilot deployment process:\nVirtual Machine starting the Windows Autopilot Deployment. Or if you really want to watch the more of the process:\nRight, that\u0026rsquo;s it, a new Windows 11 ARM Autopilot device enrolled in your Microsoft Intune tenant and ready for you to do whatever you want with it.\nSummary # This might have seemed like a long winded post for something as simple as adding in two parameters to the Virtual Machine in UTM, and you\u0026rsquo;re right, it was.\nBut now that you know how to add a serial number to a Windows 11 Virtual Machine on macOS, you can always utilise this with some of the optional steps for Windows Autopilot device preparation, using Corporate Device Identifiers allowing for uploading of Windows device identifiers (serial number, manufacturer, model) ensuring that only trusted devices go through Windows Autopilot device preparation, (once it\u0026rsquo;s no longer a known issue 😞).\nAt least now you can test your Windows settings on an new Window 11 Autopilot device from the comfort of your precious macOS device, just like I do 😅.\nIf you want an overview Windows Autopilot device preparation and the corporate device identifier process, I recommend this article from Joost Gelijsteen.

Tells you what the script will do - gives you an overview of what the script will actually do, I know, how kind of me. Gives you the rules for the Dynamic Security Groups - this is based on the extensionAttribute and featureUpdateBuild parameters selected when initially running the script, I could have automated this, but everyone has their own naming conventions so I cba. Gives you the option to stop the script - yeah, even I have panic moments when running these types of scripts, so it at least gives you the option to Alt+F4 out of it. Checks that the extensionAttribute selected isn\u0026rsquo;t already populated with something else - this one is key, I don\u0026rsquo;t want you blaming me when the script goes and overwrites an extensionAttribute you\u0026rsquo;re using for something else. If it finds any device with data in the selected extensionAttribute other than something the script has set, it\u0026rsquo;ll bin out the script. Gets all Windows devices from Entra ID - will enumerate all your Windows devices in Entra ID, as we need their objectID to allow us to add extension attributes to. Kicks off and waits for a Windows Feature Update Readiness report - using the featureUpdateBuild parameter, will start a report, wait for it to complete, then capture all the risk data. Prompts if you want to assign extension attributes - this is your final call for running away, nothing so far has been modified or updated, so use this as your option to escape if you need to. Assigns the risk based extension attributes - this is the bulk of the work, and with a little patience, depending on how many devices you actually have, will go and tag devices with their Feature Update risk rating on the extensionAttribute you chose. That\u0026rsquo;s all there is to it.\nImportantly this script can be run many many times, as we want to ensure that your devices are getting tagged with the correct risk, or if their risk has changed that it get\u0026rsquo;s updated, or if they haven\u0026rsquo;t reported back to Microsoft Intune with their readiness state, or if Microsoft have taken 52 hours to process the data and it\u0026rsquo;s only just appeared. Running the Script # So now you have an overview of what the script 😇 actually does, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we start it and what the output looks like.\nIf we want to start our journey to Windows 11 23H2, and by now you should really be looking at starting this migration, as it\u0026rsquo;s not that long until the support for Windows 10 ends, we can run the PowerShell script using the below, passing in your Entra ID Tenant ID to tenantId, the selected featureUpdateBuild, in this case 23H2, and your extensionAttribute of choice:\n.\\Invoke-Windows11Accelerator.ps1 -tenantId \u0026#39;36019fe7-a342-4d98-9126-1b6f94904ac7\u0026#39; -featureUpdateBuild \u0026#39;23H2\u0026#39; -extensionAttribute \u0026#39;15\u0026#39; -target \u0026#39;device\u0026#39; -deploy The script has been updated to support different targets, either user or device, along with an option to run this in demo mode without the deploy switch. Deployment Preparation # Following the authentication to Microsoft Graph PowerShell with Connect-MgGraph, with the scopes configured in the script as Group.ReadWrite.All, Device.ReadWrite.All, DeviceManagementManagedDevices.ReadWrite.All, DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All, we\u0026rsquo;re presented with the first stage in the process:\nThe start of the Get Ready for Windows 11 PowerShell script. Providing us with the information I promised it would, including the generated Dynamic Security Group rules allowing your to create them in Entra ID to support the Windows 11 23H2 Feature Update deployment:\nGroup Rule Low Risk (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq LowRisk-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Medium Risk (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq MediumRisk-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) High Risk (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq HighRisk-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Not Ready (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq NotReady-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Unknown (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq Unknown-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Getting Device Information # Blindly continuing the script, as so far the script has actually done nothing, it will happily go and get all your Windows devices from Entra ID, and check if there is any existing data we don\u0026rsquo;t want, in the selected extensionAttribute15, for us this time, we\u0026rsquo;re all clear, so it continues and starts the Feature Update Readiness report for Windows 11 23H2, and processes all the associated data:\nThe confirmation section of the Get Ready for Windows 11 PowerShell script. If there was data in extensionAttribute15 for any device in Entra ID, then the script would break at this point telling you to go do your homework on extensionAttributes. Now that we have details of all the devices, from both Entra ID and the Feature Update Readiness report, we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start tagging devices.\nThis is your last chance to bail out.\nRisk Tagging Devices # Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve not bottled it continued with the script, congratulations you\u0026rsquo;re on your way to delivering Windows 11 23H2 to your device estate, with the script happily churning away through the data and devices, assigning each and every one in scope of the Feature Update Readiness report.\nEach device will now be tagged on your selected extensionAttribute with their associated update risk status from:\nLow risk - There are no known compatibility risks associated with the device. Medium risk - There are only minor, or non-blocking, compatibility risks associated with this device, such as applications that are automatically removed during upgrade. High risk - There are multiple or blocking compatibility risks associated with this device, such as applications that block an upgrade. Not ready - The device isn\u0026rsquo;t capable of upgrading to the target OS version. Unknown - A readiness status couldn\u0026rsquo;t be determined. Ensure that the device is properly configured to send Windows diagnostic data. In the format of [RiskState]-W11-[FeatureUpdate] i.e., LowRisk-W11-23H2, NotReady-W11-23H2.\nThe assignment section of the Get Ready for Windows 11 PowerShell script. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d colour code the output of this section, though it serves no purpose other than to look nice.\nWhat it does show though, are devices being assigned to their respective risk rating where appropriate, and when a device has been updated to Windows 11 23H2, it will clear the extensionAttribute. If you\u0026rsquo;ve created the Dynamic Security Groups based on the rules provided by the script, they should now start slowly populating with devices.\nLeaping back to part three in the series, you\u0026rsquo;re now in a position to create your Feature Update profiles, allowing you to safely deploy the Windows 11 23H2 Feature Update to your devices categorised as low risk, whilst you assign someone else in your team to investigate the issues with the medium and high risk devices 😂.\nRemember, this script is designed to run multiple times, so after your first run, you should probably set a reminder to run it again and again until either your number of \u0026lsquo;unknown\u0026rsquo; devices is zero, or close enough that you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable to move forward with the deployment of the Feature Update. Summary # Yes I know the script could have done more, it could have created the Dynamic Security Groups and the Feature Update profiles, and assigned them whilst it was there, but two things here, firstly no-one should just blindly run a script that punts a brand new operating system out to devices, and secondly, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been able to create a series of blog posts explaining each step of the way if I\u0026rsquo;d done all the work for you in PowerShell.\nThe script, and the content of this series gives you a better understanding on how to leverage the existing information in Microsoft Intune to assist you with deploying Windows 11 23H2, well in time for the end of support date of Windows 10. It also allows you to start the deployment of the Feature Update to known low risk devices, giving you more time to investigate those with applications or drivers that are going to get removed during the update, or will block the Feature Update entirely.\nAll in all, this is a great place to start with deploying Windows 11 23H2, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t the end of your process. It is however the end of this series.\n","date":"18 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-11-risk-based-deployment-part4/","section":"Posts","summary":"The final part in this series looks at how to bring everything together under a single, repeatable script, allowing for the capture of readiness state, the tagging of devices to support the distribution of Windows 11 23H2.","title":"Risk Based Windows 11 Feature Update Deployment - Automation","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/conditional-access/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Conditional Access","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"8 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/configuration/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Configuration","type":"tags"},{"content":"So it\u0026rsquo;s finally here, after all the coming soon announcements, and the promise that we can use Entra ID authentication methods on macOS devices, we now have Platform SSO at our disposal in Microsoft Intune, well at least in Public Preview.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to deep dive into configuring Platform SSO as I\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;ve either already had a go yourself, or found someone else who has, as honestly it\u0026rsquo;s now a massive selling point of moving macOS devices into Microsoft Intune away from other MDM solutions.\nNow we can use Entra ID account for SSO on the macOS device itself, what about our good friend the web browser, and in particular Google Chrome?\nBrowser Support # If like me you\u0026rsquo;ve been patiently waiting for Platform SSO to appear, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably already looked at the pre-requisites for configuration, so let\u0026rsquo;s just assume you\u0026rsquo;ve done these already, or you\u0026rsquo;re a least aware of them, and if you haven\u0026rsquo;t sorted them, crack on and sort yourself out.\nThe bit we\u0026rsquo;re interested in is the supported browsers, and shock, both Microsoft Edge and Safari are supported out the box already (ish). Google Chrome however needs a little more convincing, as it does on Windows, to work with Single Sign On configurations.\nPlatform SSO requires you install and enable the Windows Accounts extension. You can add the app to Intune, and assign it to the devices that use Google Chrome.\nThat last line is interesting though Microsoft, as deploying Google Chrome extensions isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as click click next OK.\nLuckily though, Microsoft have provided links to setting up Google Chrome on macOS and how to configure the forced installation of extensions which we\u0026rsquo;ll be utilising to make Google Chrome and Platform SSO play nicely.\nConfiguring this extension will not only improve the users sign-in experience, but allow for the use of Conditional Access Policies when using Google Chrome:\nmacOS devices using the Enterprise SSO plugin require the Microsoft Single Sign On extension to support SSO and device-based Conditional Access in Google Chrome.\nPlatform SSO Configuration # Yes, I did say I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to dig into the Platform SSO configuration, but without actually configuring it we\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to utilise the authentication method into Google Chrome, so if you cba following the Microsoft Learn article have a look at the below, and the exported JSON which you can import into your own Microsoft Intune tenant if you\u0026rsquo;re lazy productive with your time.\nCategory Setting Value Authentication Authentication Method (Deprecated) UserSecureEnclaveKey Authentication Screen Locked Behavior Do Not Handle Authentication Registration Token {{DEVICEREGISTRATION}} Authentication Team Identifier UBF8T346G9 Authentication Extension Identifier com.microsoft.CompanyPortalMac.ssoextension Authentication Type Redirect Authentication URLs https://login.microsoftonline.com https://login.microsoft.com https://sts.windows.net https://login-us.microsoftonline.com https://login.microsoftonline.us Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO Account Display Name MEM v ENNBEE Account Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO Authentication Method UserSecureEnclaveKey Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO Enable Authorization Enabled Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO Enable Create User At Login Enabled Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO Login Frequency 64800 Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO New User Authorization Mode Standard Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO Use Shared Device Keys Enabled Authentication \u0026gt; Platform SSO User Authorization Mode Standard This settings catalog profile is configured to use UserSecureEnclaveKey for Passwordless authentication, but feel free to amend any other settings in the Microsoft Learn article as you see fit.\nAssigning this to a group of test devices, yes I do actually test things, you should get the glorious device registration and sign-in experience with Entra ID credentials we\u0026rsquo;ve all been after.\nIf you encounter issues with the Entra Join and registration, have a look at the troubleshooting guide for Platform SSO, specifically the Entra Join permissions. Google Chrome Deployment # With the Platform SSO configuration setup and deployed, we can now focus our attention on how we manage Google Chrome on macOS devices, including delivering the app, as well as configuring it to support the required Microsoft Single Sign On extension.\nI shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be teaching you all to suck eggs, but for completions sake, we should probably go through deploying Google Chrome to your Microsoft Intune enrolled macOS devices, and we\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple of ways to do this, depending on whether you want to force install this on your end user devices, or allow the app to be installed by the user.\nRequired App Deployment # If you just want to get the latest version of Google Chrome out there to all assigned devices, then the easiest approach is to use a Shell Script and in particular the one in the shell-intune-samples GitHub repository, which will run on a device, got get the latest Google Chrome version download, and install it.\nSetting Value Upload Script installGoogleChrome.zsh Run script as signed-in user No Hide script notifications on devices Not configured Script frequency Not configured Max number of times to retry if script fails 3 times Shell Script for deploying Google Chrome to macOS devices in Microsoft Intune.. After your assigned group of test devices check in to Microsoft Intune and the script runs successfully, your devices should download and install Google Chrome.\nIf you want to see progress or errors with the script, the script log file is located in /Library/Logs/Microsoft/IntuneScripts/GoogleChrome on the targetted macOS device. Available App Deployment # If you want to make the app available to your end users via the Company Portal, and who doesn\u0026rsquo;t love self-service, then go ahead and download the pkg installer.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;re looking to make the app available our only option in Microsoft Intune is to upload the file using the Line-of-business app, as pkg apps although great for pre and post deployment scripts, don\u0026rsquo;t give the option for making apps available in the Company Portal.\nSetting Value Select file GoogleChrome.pkg Name Google Chrome Description Chrome is the official web browser from Google, built to be fast, secure and customisable.

Give the configuration profile a suitable name, I\u0026rsquo;ve gone with Google Chrome Platform SSO Profile, as really you\u0026rsquo;re only going to see this on the device itself under the Profile section of System Preferences.\nAs the custom profile sets the PayloadScope as System our Deployment channel should be set to Device channel. We should probably assign this profile to our test devices, so go ahead and do that, and after a while we should get some greens:\nCustom Profile Report in Microsoft Intune for macOS. Checking on the assigned macOS 14 test device itself under System Preferences \u0026gt; Privacy \u0026amp; Security \u0026gt; Profiles we can see the profile has installed correctly:\nThe profile installed under System Preferences. One last thing to look at, and that\u0026rsquo;s the extensions in Google Chrome itself:\nGoogle Chrome installed extensions. It is, and the user is unable to disable or remove it, as why would we want them to?\nSo what does SSO look like on Google Chrome with Secure Enclave key authentication? Well it\u0026rsquo;s the same process as with Microsoft Edge and Safari:\nA user opens the browser and accesses a Microsoft Entra authenticated service such as outlook.office.com. If there is a valid token for the user, the user is not prompted to sign-in to the service, otherwise re-authentication with TouchID is required before access. Subsequent login prompts to Microsoft Entra authenticated services like teams.microsoft.com are now automatically passed through using SSO. All that to make browser sign-ins a little easier and to allow for the use of Conditional Access Policies 😅.\nIf you encounter issues with Google Chrome SSO, please refer to the Microsoft Learn documentation. Summary # Platform SSO on macOS in Microsoft Intune is a big thing, it\u0026rsquo;s likely the last hurdle or excuse people were using to stay away from using a Microsoft product to manage an Apple device.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re already in bed with Microsoft and associated services, then something as trivial as where your precious Apple devices are managed shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be stopping you from jumping two footed straight into enrolling your macOS devices into Microsoft Intune, especially now that you can use Entra ID authentication across them.\nOn top of this, we can now configure the most used browsers on a macOS device to leverage and make use of Platform SSO, to stop users from being bogged down with sign-in prompts that their colleagues on low-spec Windows laptops don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a win win in my books.\n","date":"8 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/macos-platformsso-google-chrome/","section":"Posts","summary":"With all the hype about Platform SSO on macOS devices, now is the time to try out not just the standard functionality, but the integration into web browsers such as Google Chrome.

All of this is useful when deploying a Windows 11 Feature Update, in this instance 23H2, to devices, so let\u0026rsquo;s look at how we actually deploy the new Feature Update to these groups of devices and get you on your Windows 11 journey.\nUsing Feature Update Profiles # Yes, I am usually against silently paywalled areas of Microsoft Intune, but there isn\u0026rsquo;t really any better way of getting devices upgraded to a Feature Update in a controlled manner, you could use Target Release Version but then you\u0026rsquo;re risking all devices updating all at once, or using deferral settings for Feature Updates in Windows Update Rings, but that all relies on the data the Feature Update is released, not ideal really.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, if you\u0026rsquo;re not already covered by one of the (at time of writing) license pre-requisites to use Feature Update profiles then I suggest finding some cash down the back of the sofa.\nLicensing Pre-requisites # So let\u0026rsquo;s make sure you\u0026rsquo;re covered by the requirements for Feature Update first, starting with the licenses, make sure your are covered for the \u0026lsquo;Windows Update for Business deployment service\u0026rsquo; with have one of the below licenses:\nWindows 10/11 Enterprise E3 or E5 (included in Microsoft 365 F3, E3, or E5) Windows 10/11 Education A3 or A5 (included in Microsoft 365 A3 or A5) Windows Virtual Desktop Access E3 or E5 Microsoft 365 Business Premium In addition to a license for Intune, your organization must have one of the following subscriptions that include a license for Windows Update for Business deployment service.\nThat should be pretty easy to sort out, it\u0026rsquo;s only one license isn\u0026rsquo;t it Microsoft? Please don\u0026rsquo;t audit me.\nTelemetry Pre-requisites # Reading through the other requirements, one of which we already touched upon in part one, and you should have configured as part of using the Feature Update Readiness Report, is telemetry data.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;ve gotten to this part of the series and you\u0026rsquo;re still wondering why your reports are empty, it\u0026rsquo;s probably the fact that when Windows 10 was first released all those years ago, you aggressively disabled telemetry reporting for fear of Microsoft using your data.\nWell, here we are now, needed this telemetry data, go and configure a Settings Catalog profile with the settings below and assign it to all your devices, do it now.\nCategory Setting Value Description System Allow Telemetry Basic Sends all required telemetry information to Microsoft. System Configure Telemetry Opt In Change Notification Disable telemetry change notifications Stops users panicking about data, what they don\u0026rsquo;t know won\u0026rsquo;t hurt them. System Configure Telemetry Opt In Settings Ux Disable Telemetry opt-in Settings Stops users from changing telemetry settings This, once Microsoft has processed your data, will allow for the delivery of Feature Updates.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re almost done, I promise.\nService Pre-requisites # Well, who\u0026rsquo;s been caught out with the issue where monthly updates happily deploy, but you\u0026rsquo;ve been scratching your head about why Feature Updates haven\u0026rsquo;t been offered to a device yet?\nYeah me neither, but we should at least be definite with this requirement that the Microsoft Account Sign-In Assistant (wlidsvc) is not disabled.\nCategory Setting Value Description Accounts Allow Microsoft Account Sign In Assistant Manual start If this is disabled, will block the use of Feature Updates on Windows 10 and later devices. This will set the service is set to Manual (Trigger Start), which allows it to run when needed. You may as well lob the above setting into the same Settings Catalog profile as the telemetry data settings, saves creating multiple granular profiles when you\u0026rsquo;re not dealing with specific exclusions, giving us something like the below.\nMicrosoft Intune settings catalog policy. Right, on to setting up the Feature Update profiles.\nTargetting Feature Update Profiles # As we\u0026rsquo;re not using deferral settings within Windows Update Rings, and instead opting for the use of Feature Update profiles to deploy new versions of the Windows operating system, we need to set all Feature Update deferrals in our existing Update Rings to be zero, but to stop the flood of devices attempt to update to a newer version of Windows 10 or 11, before we change this setting, let\u0026rsquo;s look at how we keep devices at the required level.\nFeature Update Dynamic Groups # That\u0026rsquo;s right, more Dynamic Device Security Groups, this time we\u0026rsquo;re going to ring-fence devices based on the operating system they are currently running, and assign a corresponding Feature Update of the same version, yes this sounds a little backward when our end goal is to upgrade devices to Windows 11 23H2, but bear with me there\u0026rsquo;s logic around this.\nBased on the current (at time of writing) Feature Update versions available in Microsoft Intune, we need to create at groups for at least each of the below versions.\nMicrosoft Feature Update profile with immediate installation. So go and create some new groups in Entra ID with the below rules to capture your corporate owned Windows devices at each Feature Update version\nGroup Rule Windows 10 21H2 (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSVersion -startswith \u0026quot;10.0.19044\u0026quot;) Windows 10 22H2 (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSVersion -startswith \u0026quot;10.0.19045\u0026quot;) Windows 11 21H2 (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSVersion -startswith \u0026quot;10.0.22000\u0026quot;) Windows 11 22H2 (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSVersion -startswith \u0026quot;10.0.22621\u0026quot;) Windows 11 23H2 (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOSVersion -startswith \u0026quot;10.0.22631\u0026quot;) Your mileage may vary with this, as it could be you\u0026rsquo;ve got other devices that aren\u0026rsquo;t covered by one of these Feature Update profile versions, if that is the case create dynamic device groups for these other versions too, and we\u0026rsquo;ll work out what to do with them later.\nFeature Update Version # With our grouped devices based on version at hand, we can now create Feature Update Profiles for each of these versions, configuring them to be immediately available, and assigned to the dynamic device groups we/ve just created.\nFeature Update Version Rollout options Group Windows 10, version 21H2 Make update available as soon as possible Windows 10 21H2 Windows 10, version 22H2 Make update available as soon as possible Windows 10 22H2 Windows 11, version 21H2 Make update available as soon as possible Windows 11 21H2 Windows 11, version 22H2 Make update available as soon as possible Windows 11 22H2 Windows 11, version 23H2 Make update available as soon as possible Windows 11 23H2 For your devices that are running lower versions of Windows 10, then you\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple of options, either assign the group to one of the above newly created version targeting Feature Update profiles, or, using a Settings Catalog profile with Target Release Version configured to the required version to keep your LTSC or otherwise Windows 10 devices exactly where they need to be.\nWith these now in place, we can happily remove the Feature Update deferral settings in our Windows Update rings, without the fear that devices are just going to jump to a version we don\u0026rsquo;t want them to be on, yet.\nDeployment Feature Update Profiles # Now you may be thinking, all of this is well and good, but how are we going to distribute Windows 11 23H2 after gathering compatibility data and grouping devices based on their upgrade risk, well, fear not, as there is documented behaviour when a device is in scope of multiple Feature Update profiles, in short, a device will install the most recent Feature Update version, in long\u0026hellip;\nEach Windows feature update policy supports a single update. When a device is targeted by more than one policy, it might be targeted with multiple update versions. The Windows Update service can only offer a device one feature update at a time, and always offers the latest update version that targets the device. Because Windows 11 updates are considered to be later versions than Windows 10, the service always offers the Windows 11 update to a device targeted by both Windows 10 and Windows 11 updates. This is done because deploying a Windows 11 update to a Windows 10 device is a supported upgrade path. So this behaviour is exactly what we need, a way to keep devices on their current version, until they are in scope of a newer version, in this case, Windows 11 23H2.\nDeploying Windows 11 Feature Updates # Onto the fun part, the fruition of my our hard work, being able to roll out Windows 11 23H2 safely. Let\u0026rsquo;s go and create a new Feature Update profile for Windows 11 23H2 for our low risk devices, this time instead of an immediate roll out option, we\u0026rsquo;re going to utilise the \u0026lsquo;Make update available gradually\u0026rsquo; option, which uses magic \u0026#x1fa84;.\nMicrosoft Feature Update profile with phased installation. Well it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily magic, there must be something in the background that allows the splitting of a targeted include assignment group or groups into equal sized smaller manageable virtual groups between the start date and end date, separated by number of days between them.\nA few things to note before we go and assign this profile:\nThe start of the first group availability must be at least two days in advance of the current date, which allows the magic to happen to split the devices. The final group availability may not occur on the specified date, based on the how many days between groups has been configured, something about maths and whole numbers. Installation deadlines and grace periods in Windows Update rings are adhered to, so ensure that you have this configured to something sensible, and lower than the number of days between groups otherwise you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with overlapping deployments. We\u0026rsquo;re here, the end, we have a profile for deploying Windows 11 23H2 and we can assign this to our ready to go, low risk tagged, group of Windows 10 devices, that\u0026rsquo;s exciting.\nMicrosoft Feature Update profile assignment. With these devices telling you that they\u0026rsquo;re happy to update to Windows 11, you can safely sit back and watch the reports update with the status of the Feature Update deployment, giving you time to work through the issues reported by the medium and high risk device issues.\nOr if you\u0026rsquo;re like me, just take a chance deploying the Feature Update to the medium risk devices, I mean who cares if a driver get\u0026rsquo;s removed, you should be updating them anyway 😂.\nSummary # This should now give you confidence in deploying a Windows 11 Feature Update to the devices that have told you that they\u0026rsquo;re OK to update, based on the Microsoft backed information captured from the Readiness Report, starting your migration to Windows 11 from Windows 10 well before the end of support, pat yourself on the back.\nEven if all of your Windows 10 and later devices are reporting their compatibility information, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the end of the story, what if you\u0026rsquo;ve resolved some of the medium or high risk issues? What if those devices that were captured by medium or high risk tags are now reporting as low risk? What if there are new Windows 10 devices enrolled into Microsoft Intune? What if devices that had low disk space now have enough free space?\nThese are all valid questions I\u0026rsquo;ve just come up with, and in the last part of this series, I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking you through a PowerShell script that combines what we\u0026rsquo;ve covered into a fool-proof deployment that can be run regularly, ensuring that Windows 10 devices don\u0026rsquo;t get left behind.\n","date":"5 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-11-risk-based-deployment-part3/","section":"Posts","summary":"Using the data captured from a Windows 11 Feature Update Readiness report to successfully tag device attributes to device objects, and group them based on risk, we now look at how to deploy Feature Updates to these devices in a controlled manner.","title":"Risk Based Windows 11 Feature Update Deployment - Feature Updates","type":"posts"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;d strongly suggest, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already, skimming over the first part of this series as this will give you a good understanding of where we started, and hopefully where we\u0026rsquo;re trying to get to with putting the Feature Update Readiness Reports in Microsoft Intune to good use allowing for a risk based deployment approach of Windows 11 23H2.\nMicrosoft Feature Update readiness report. With our precious data in hand, we can move onto how we group devices based on the risk, and hopefully make the transition to Windows 11 a relatively painless one.\nDevice Attributes # Those with a keen pair of eyes, may have spotted a previous post allowing the tagging of a device using device attributes for exceptions to Conditional Access Policies, and I may have hinted at the time that these attributes may have other uses. Well guess what, they do.\nWe can take the data from the Readiness Report, that we formatted and updated with both a string representation of the risk state, and the Entra ID computer ObjectId of the device, and use this information to tag devices with their risk state for the Windows 11 Feature Update they were assessed against. Clever eh?\nGetting Existing Device Attribute Values # We\u0026rsquo;ve already got a function to update device attributes on device objects, and I say update, as the call to Graph is using PATCH which means that it will overwrite the existing value for the attribute we want to update.\nThis is both good, as it means we don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about changes to the devices Feature Update risk state, and bad, because we should probably check that our chosen attribute is not already used for something else, like for Conditional Access Policies exclusions.\nSo can we find a way to pull back all devices where our device attribute of choice, this time extensionAttribute15, is not empty? Sure why not.\nConnect to Graph using the latest module and Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'Device.ReadWrite.All'. $extensionAttribute = \u0026#39;extensionAttribute15\u0026#39; $windowsDevices = Get-EntraIDDevice | Where-Object { $_.operatingSystem -eq \u0026#39;Windows\u0026#39; } foreach ($windowsDevice in $windowsDevices) { $attribute = ($windowsDevice.extensionAttributes | ConvertTo-Json | ConvertFrom-Json).$extensionAttribute if ($attribute){ Write-Host \u0026#34;$($windowsDevice.displayName) already has a value of \u0026#39;$attribute\u0026#39; configured in extension attribute $extensionAttribute\u0026#34; -ForegroundColor Red } } This can be run in isolation, to check before assigning the risk based device attributes whether you\u0026rsquo;re going to be overwriting anything important, as the PATCH to update the attribute is pretty destructive.\nFor our situation, we know what values to actually expect on the device attribute that are valid (LowRisk-W11-23H2, MediumRisk-W11-23H2, HighRisk-W11-23H2, NotReady-W11-23H2, Unknown-W11-23H2), so we should expand upon the above to add some depth to the logic by creating an array variable of safe extension attribute values in $safeAttributes, which will allow us to run the assignment of attribute values multiple times, which is going to be important.\n$extensionAttribute = \u0026#39;extensionAttribute15\u0026#39; $windowsDevices = Get-EntraIDDevice | Where-Object { $_.operatingSystem -eq \u0026#39;Windows\u0026#39; } $attributeErrors = 0 $safeAttributes = @(\u0026#34;LowRisk-W11-23H2\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;MediumRisk-W11-23H2\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;HighRisk-W11-23H2\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;NotReady-W11-23H2\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;Unknown-W11-23H2\u0026#34;) foreach ($windowsDevice in $windowsDevices) { $attribute = ($windowsDevice.extensionAttributes | ConvertTo-Json | ConvertFrom-Json).$extensionAttribute if ($attribute -notin $safeAttributes){ if ($null -ne $attribute){ Write-Host \u0026#34;$($windowsDevice.displayName) already has a value of \u0026#39;$attribute\u0026#39; configured in extension attribute $extensionAttribute\u0026#34; -ForegroundColor Yellow $attributeErrors = $attributeErrors + 1 } } } if ($attributeErrors -gt 0){ Write-Host \u0026#34;Please review the devices reporting as having existing data in the selected attribute $extensionAttribute, and run the script using a different attribute selection.\u0026#34; -ForegroundColor Red break } The above will now check to see if our selected extension attribute extensionAttribute15 contains a value not in the safe list, or not null, and increment an error variable $attributeErrors, then throw a wobbly if the value of that variable is greater than zero.\nPre-flight checks over for now, onto assigning a value to our attribute.\nUpdating Device Attributes # We\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with this function previously, so no need to go into detail on this one, but it is expecting some JSON content and an Id to be able to assign the attribute values.\nFunction Add-DeviceAttribute() { [cmdletbinding()] param ( [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $JSON, [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $Id ) $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;Beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#34;devices/$Id\u0026#34; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Patch -Body $JSON -ContentType \u0026#39;application/json\u0026#39; } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } Using the above and the data we have previously captured in part one in the $reportArray variable:\nUpdated Readiness report data array. We can loop through each and every device in the array, and with the values for both the RiskState and ObjectID we can happily update some attributes.\nForeach ($object in $reportArray) { $JSON = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;extensionAttributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$extensionAttribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$($object.RiskState)\u0026#34; } } \u0026#34;@ Add-DeviceAttribute -Id $object.ObjectID -JSON $JSON Start-Sleep -Seconds 3 } Now while totally suitable, and will work it\u0026rsquo;s way through the devices updating them based on the initial run, we need to be able to update the same extension attribute in subsequent runs, and with the call to Graph using PATCH we\u0026rsquo;re covered, but there is no RiskState for devices already upgraded to the Windows 11 Feature Update version, so devices following an upgrade and new readiness report, will still be tagged with their old risk rating.\nMaintaining Device Attributes # I\u0026rsquo;m not usually this tidy with my scripts, but we should clean up after ourselves, and as the Feature Update Readiness Report relies on a number of moving parts, no less devices themselves sending data, and the 52 hours of waiting for data to process, the aim here is to regularly run the whole script to ensure accurate assessment and tagging of devices.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s add a little something something, and using the values from ReadinessStatus we can assess whether a device is already upgraded to our Windows 11 Feature Update version or not based on the ReadinessStatus equalling 4 and send the correct JSON data to Graph to ensure consistent assignment of the value of the extension attribute.\nForeach ($object in $reportArray) { if ($object.ReadinessStatus -ne \u0026#39;4\u0026#39;) { $JSON = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;extensionAttributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$extensionAttribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$($object.RiskState)\u0026#34; } } \u0026#34;@ } else { $JSON = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;extensionAttributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;$extensionAttribute\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } \u0026#34;@ } Add-DeviceAttribute -Id $object.ObjectID -JSON $JSON Start-Sleep -Seconds 3 } There we go, we can tag our devices using extension attributes with their risk state, not just once, but many many times, and keep on top of devices that have been updated to Windows 11 already.\nA quick straw poll of devices in Entra ID, we can see that the tag has applied successfully:\nWe should do something sensible with these tags on the devices now.\nDynamic Security Groups # Ah my love affair between Dynamic Security Groups and Device Filters rears it\u0026rsquo;s head again, and despite the recommendations to stop using certain operators, there are still times when Dynamic Groups are going to win out over Device Filters.\nWith Feature Update deployments in Microsoft Intune not supporting the use of Device Filters, and as we\u0026rsquo;ve tagged the Entra ID object of the device, and not the Microsoft Intune object, we don\u0026rsquo;t have any say in the matter, so we have to use groups this time.\nFeature Update assignment in Microsoft Intune. So what are we doing with the groups? Well we can create dynamic device groups to capture corporate owned Windows devices based on their risk state.\nCreating Dynamic Device Security Groups # So off you go, create some groups with the below rules, and if you\u0026rsquo;ve been following along, you\u0026rsquo;ll realise that we now have ring-fenced devices based on just how ready they are to update to Windows 11. Cool eh? (rhetorical, it is obviously cool.)\nGroup Rule Low Risk (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq LowRisk-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Medium Risk (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq MediumRisk-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) High Risk (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq HighRisk-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Not Ready (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq NotReady-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Unknown (device.extensionAttribute15 -eq Unknown-W11-23H2) and (device.deviceOSType -eq Windows) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq Company) Give the groups a little while to populate, hopefully not 24 hours, but all being well and good, the members should flood in.\nGroup Membership Check # Ok ok, let\u0026rsquo;s not just take my word for it, after all we\u0026rsquo;re not best friends colleagues just yet, in fact I bet some of you don\u0026rsquo;t even follow me on LinkedIn 😅, anyway let\u0026rsquo;s look at the output of the report we initially created.\nMicrosoft Feature Update readiness report. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the break down of devices in each risk category:\nLow Risk - 278 devices Medium Risk - 68 devices High Risk - 0 devices (lucky) Not Ready - 14 devices Unknown - 48 devices Now have a look at the obviously un-doctored screenshots of each of our Dynamic Device Security Groups:\nAnd there you have it, matchy matchy values for each of the risk types. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice there isn\u0026rsquo;t a group for the three devices already upgraded to Windows 11 23H2, as we don\u0026rsquo;t care about these ones for the purpose of a Feature Update to the same version that\u0026rsquo;s already installed.\nSummary # We\u0026rsquo;re on the home stretch now, having captured all the data we need to truly assess the readiness state of a deployment of a Windows 11 23H2 feature update, successfully tagging the Windows device objects in Entra ID with a suitably named risk state, and gathered all devices of the same risk state using Dynamic Device Security Groups.\nWhat else do you want from me? Ah yes, a way to utilise the groups we created as part of deploying the Feature Update, you know the whole point of this series. Tune in next week time for the next exciting post in this series.

Though maybe I should have got this post out sooner looking at the reception that the update has gotten since its release.\nEither way, as Microsoft Intune is now a safe space for macOS device management, instead of the mild headache it used to be, we can now look at how we control the update of software on these devices, so macOS users don\u0026rsquo;t escape the same fate placed upon your normal everyday Windows user.\nUpdate Configuration Precedence # I wish this was as straight forward as Windows Update Rings, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t, and with the recent changes to macOS device management in Microsoft Intune, we now have three different ways to control updates on these devices.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure we needed all three, but there is a clear documented hierarchy for the settings, along with which versions of macOS support each. In summary though, the precedence of update configuration profiles looks like this:\nManaged software updates - Settings catalog \u0026gt; Declarative Device Management \u0026gt; Software Update Update policies - Devices \u0026gt; Update policies for macOS Software updates - Settings catalog \u0026gt; System Updates \u0026gt; Software Update I\u0026rsquo;m going to avoid numbers 1 and 2, and although this goes against my love of all things latest and greatest, and leans on the user to install updates, it does give us the functionality of phased updates we require, and without reliance on specific versions of the operating system.\nDeployment Approach # As with our previous look at update deployment across Windows devices, we\u0026rsquo;re going to split our macOS device estate into key deployment groups, this time we\u0026rsquo;re back with four, I\u0026rsquo;ll explain why later.\nSticking with the Pilot, Pre-production, and production deployment approach, we end up with something like the below:\nPilot - This should be a stratified sample of either users or devices, ~5% of your device estate. Pre-Production - The early adopters deployment, ~15% of your device estate. Initial Production - The first production deployment, ~30% of your device estate. Final Production - The final production deployment, the remaining ~50% of the device estate. These groups can be used not just for macOS software updates, but also with some additional configuration, Microsoft Updates as well. What a world we live in.\nDeployment Groups # As we like to please Microsoft, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use what are referred to as efficient groups, stopping the use operators like match, in the hope that they reinstate Microsoft Developer Intune subscriptions for free.\nGroup Type Membership Pilot Group Assigned TBC Pre-Production Group Dynamic Device (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;MacMDM\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and ((device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;0\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;a\u0026quot;)) Initial Production Group Dynamic Device (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;MacMDM\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and ((device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;2\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;3\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;4\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;b\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;c\u0026quot;)) Final Production Group Dynamic Device (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;MacMDM\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and ((device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;5\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;6\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;7\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;8\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;9\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;d\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;e\u0026quot;) or (device.deviceId -startsWith \u0026quot;f\u0026quot;)) These groups will naturally split your macOS device estate across the three pre-production and production dynamic groups, allowing for suitable phasing of the delivery of updates.\nWith the Pilot group, you should add devices into this group that you want to get updates the earliest, so actual pilot devices here please, not your own or your work besties.\nDeployment Assignments # To ensure that we aren\u0026rsquo;t getting conflict with policy assignment, we need to ensure a device is receiving more than one update policy, whether this is a Software Update or otherwise 😉.\nAs we\u0026rsquo;ve got the Dynamic Groups ring-fencing devices based on device.deviceId, the only conflict we may encounter is with the assigned group.\nTo alleviate that conflict, we need to ensure that all our update ring assignments are excluding this group:\nUpdate Ring Included Groups Excluded Groups Pilot Pilot Group - Pre-Production Pre-Production Group Pilot Group Initial Production Initial Production Group Pilot Group Final Production Final Production Group Pilot Group This approach can be used across all update assignment settings covered in the rest of this post.\nSoftware Update Configuration # Before we start looking at the option to delay or defer software updates, we need to create a baseline configuration that sets devices update preference settings, to allow for this phased approach of update delivery.\nSo with a quick Settings Catalog profile created with the below settings, and assigned to your devices, we can ensure that the devices will get the updates they need, but when we tell them:\nCategory Setting Value Software Update Config Data Install True Software Update Automatic Check Enabled True Software Update Allow Pre Release Installation False Software Update Critical Update Install True Software Update Restrict Software Update Require Admin To Install False Software Update Automatic Download True Microsoft Intune Settings Catalog for macOS Software Update settings. You\u0026rsquo;ll notice that for Critical Update Install and Config Data Install we\u0026rsquo;re allowing these to just happen, you should, as they\u0026rsquo;re important. What we want to control is when devices get OS updates, not leaving gaping security flaws in devices.\nPhased Software Updates # The phasing of Software update is a little bit of a pain, but it can be achieved using the below settings, creating one Settings Catalog profile for each deployment group. Now you don\u0026rsquo;t get the same pause and uninstall functionality as you would with Windows Update Rings, but at least you\u0026rsquo;re not pushing out updates all at once to devices.\nUpdate Ring Automatically Install App Updates Automatically Install Mac OS Updates Force Delayed App Software Updates Force Delayed Software Updates Enforced Software Update Delay Enforced Software Update Non OS Deferred Install Delay Enforced Software Update Minor OS Deferred Install Delay Pilot True True False False - - - Pre-Production False False True True 5 5 5 Initial Production False False True True 9 9 9 Final Production False False True True 12 12 12 These phased deployment of updates across the groups, will ensure that there is enough time between each phase to identify any issues (cough like with Sonoma 14.4 cough), allowing for some level of testing of updates prior to a full deployment across your whole macOS device estate.\nWhen assigning these profiles to the created deployment groups, ensure that you are excluding the Pilot group from the pre-production and production profiles. Software Update Results # Seeing the Settings Catalog profiles in action, with a first look at the configuration being applied:\nmacOS Update Configuration Settings. Looks good, and matches what we\u0026rsquo;ve configured in our baseline software update profile.\nChecking on the status of the updates, we\u0026rsquo;ve actually got Sonoma 14.4 available on this device, regardless of the deployment group it\u0026rsquo;s a member of, as 7+12=19 (quick maths) which is less than the date of this post:\nmacOS Update Configuration Settings. Luckily we\u0026rsquo;ll be ready with our configured deferral settings for the next macOS software update release, and I hope it goes a little better than this release.\nMicrosoft AutoUpdate Settings # Bringing additional functionality to our update deployments, and to allow for the management of visibility and installation of any update covered under the Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) application, we need to to implement some more baseline settings to configure Microsoft AutoUpdate.\nSo go create yourself another Settings Catalog profile, and throw the below settings into it:\nCategory Setting Value Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Disable Office Insider membership True Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Enable AutoUpdate True Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Number of minutes for the final countdown timer 60 Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Register app on launch True Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Update channel Current Channel Microsoft AutoUpdate (MAU) Update check frequency (mins) 240 Microsoft Intune Settings Catalog for macOS Microsoft AutoUpdate settings. Feel free to amened the Number of minutes for the final countdown timer and Update check frequency (mins) if you like your user base more than I do.\nUpdated the Enable AutoUpdate settings based on feedback from Somesh Pathak (MVP) Phased Microsoft Updates # To phase the delivery of Microsoft Application updates across the four deployment groups, you will need to create four separate Settings Catalog profiles with the below settings, with restrictions configured to stop users checking for updates and relying on the deferral and deadline settings where applicable.\nUpdate Ring Enable check for updates Deferred updates Days before forced updates Pilot True - - Pre-Production False Defer 3 days 2 Initial Production False Defer 7 days 2 Final Production False Defer 7 days 5 You can now see why I stuck with four deployment groups, as we love working within the National Cyber Security Centre guidelines to ensure that updates are installed in that wonderful 14-day window, and the Microsoft AutoUpdate configuration only allows set values for Deferred updates.\nWhen assigning these profiles to the created deployment groups, ensure that you are excluding the Pilot group from the pre-production and production profiles. Microsoft Update Results # Checking in on a device that is set to defer and delay the installation of Microsoft Updates, we can see that the profile has applied correctly:\nMicrosoft AutoUpdate Settings. With no ability for the end user to install the updates on their own, and the correct configuration applied to the device we\u0026rsquo;re off to a good start.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at the updates themselves:\nMicrosoft AutoUpdate Updates. Perfect, the Microsoft AutoUpdate application has detected that there are actually updates, but will adhere to the deferral and deadline settings, ensuring that the application updates do get installed, but when we want them to, not at the whim of the end user.\nSummary # With each deployment group now configured to get update deferrals and installation deadlines for Software, Operating System, and Microsoft Applications aligned to the same day, we have the ability to unify the deployment approach of updates to Microsoft Intune managed macOS devices.\nThis may not give us all the functionality we want just yet, still relying on users to carry out installations, but until there is another flexible approach to enforced software updates that doesn\u0026rsquo;t rely on check-in or day of the week, or scripts and property lists, or community tools like nudge, this will have to do.\nWe are at least, one step closer to getting some level of feature parity between device management for Windows devices and macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with more on the horizon, it\u0026rsquo;s a good time to be a hybrid macOS and Windows device consultant.\n","date":"6 April 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/macos-updates-phased-deployment/","section":"Posts","summary":"So you\u0026rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.","title":"Software Update Deployment Rings for Managed macOS Devices","type":"posts"},{"content":"At the time of writing we are only a few hundred days away from the end of support of Windows 10 22H2, and really we should all be recommending the move to Windows 11, not just because it\u0026rsquo;s shiny and new, but also it\u0026rsquo;s going to actually get security updates.\nMany organisations are happily running Windows 10 and have been for some time, and have probably dabbled with Windows 11, mainly IT staff who wanted to be on the latest and greatest. This however isn\u0026rsquo;t going to get your devices to Windows 11 any time soon, and instead of distributing a Feature Update blindly, we should probably make use of the information in the Feature Update Readiness Reports in Microsoft Intune.\nThis report is useful from a visibility perspective, we can see the risk of updating a device to a specific Feature Update, drill into effected devices, and get a greater understanding of the overall Windows 11 readiness for a device estate.

These readiness states are all going to be pretty handy, as we hopefully can capture those devices that are at a level of risk, or unknown risk of an update to Windows 11, and allow a targeted and safe deployment of the Feature Update.\nReport Pre-requisites # This one is a bit of a kicker, and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend looking at the pre-requisites as soon as possible, in fact, go look at them now and come back when you\u0026rsquo;ve implemented them\u0026hellip;\nRight, now they\u0026rsquo;re in place, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about why I told you to just go ahead and turn some things on, well in order for us to use the report, we need to ensure that devices are able to send data, Microsoft is able to process the data, and the fact you have to wait 52 hours for the data to be processed.\nSo based on this, anything we do using the data needs to be able to run multiple times, as not all devices in the estate are going to send their data at the same time.\nGraph and Feature Update Readiness Reports # Let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can get the report data using the Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK, as always I\u0026rsquo;ve investigated the calls to Graph using Developer Tools in my browser of choice (Microsoft Edge, obviously), and from my findings and the fact that reports are individual to the account running them, we need a way to start a report, and then get the report.\nCreating Feature Update Readiness Reports # We\u0026rsquo;ll start with the call to create a new readiness report, we need to POST to deviceManagement/reports/cachedReportConfigurations with some JSON content in the below format, specifying the version of Feature Update we want to report on, for us, we want Windows 11 23H2, so the value we\u0026rsquo;re after is NI23H2.\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;MEMUpgradeReadinessDevice_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;filter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;(TargetOS eq \u0026#39;NI23H2\u0026#39;) and (DeviceScopesTag eq \u0026#39;00000\u0026#39;)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;orderBy\u0026#34;: [], \u0026#34;select\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;DeviceName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DeviceManufacturer\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DeviceModel\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;OSVersion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ReadinessStatus\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;SystemRequirements\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AppIssuesCount\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;DriverIssuesCount\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AppOtherIssuesCount\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;metadata\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;TargetOS=\u0026gt;filterPicker=V2luZG93cyUyMDExJTIwLSUyMHZlcnNpb24lMjAyMkgy,DeviceScopesTag=\u0026gt;filterPicker=RGVmYXVsdA==\u0026#34; } This will then start the generation of a report in the background, which isn\u0026rsquo;t instant, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need a way to not only capture the report data, but also a way to wait until it\u0026rsquo;s available. At least we\u0026rsquo;ve got a way to kick off a report, so we should create a function to do this, you know, so it\u0026rsquo;s easily repeatable.\nEnsure that you\u0026rsquo;re connecting to Graph using the latest module and Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All', we\u0026rsquo;ll need some more scopes later, but for now this one will do.

Let\u0026rsquo;s look at how we can leverage the web service to create some much needed firewall settings.\nReusable Settings Groups # So here we are, back looking at Defender Windows firewall rules in Microsoft Intune again, and after moving legacy firewall rules to the Settings Catalog versions previously, to make use of Reusable Settings Groups, we\u0026rsquo;re now heavily leaning into these reusable options, to ensure that all Windows 10 and later devices can communicate successfully to the Microsoft Online endpoints.\nBefore we look at how to deal with the data available in the Microsoft web service, we should look at how we can create these reusable settings groups in Microsoft Intune using Graph, and make use of the option to auto resolve URLs, which should make life a little bit easier for the ever changing internet landscape.\nJSON Formatting # We at least have experience dealing with building the JSON structure required for Settings Catalog profiles previously, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t particularly straight forward, so after a hesitant dig with Developer Tools we can see that when you create a new reusable setting in Microsoft Intune, we\u0026rsquo;re sending a POST call to the deviceManagement/reusablePolicySettings endpoint, with JSON similar to the below.\n{ \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ReusableTest\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;My very first reusable group.\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingInstance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationGroupSettingCollectionInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupSettingCollectionValue\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;choiceSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve_true\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [] } }, { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_keyword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;simpleSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;memv.ennbee.uk\u0026#34; } } ] }, { \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;choiceSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve_false\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingCollectionInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_addresses\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;simpleSettingCollectionValue\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8.8.8.8\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue\u0026#34; } ] } ] } }, { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_keyword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;simpleSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Google DNS\u0026#34; } } ] } ] }, \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementReusablePolicySetting\u0026#34; } Comparing this with the created reusable group below, we can see that each children section of the JSON structure is looking after each of created items.\nReusable firewall settings in Microsoft Intune. With a single children section for each auto resolve URL, and one section containing each of the IP addresses, and luckily for us, the structure of the JSON is the same whether it\u0026rsquo;s the first setting in the list or the last, bar a trailing ,.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s look at how we can use PowerShell to build out our JSON structure for a reusable settings group.\nBuilding the JSON Format # This one looks a lot less of a headache compared to building Settings Catalog JSON structures, with hopefully minimal logic needed to distinguish the first and subsequent settings, and very few variables to handle and pass in, to allow the creation of our very own reusable settings group containing all the URLs and IP addresses from the Microsoft web service.\nWe can break down the whole JSON structure into $*JSON variable sections that can be updated with subsequent variables when processing the captured data from the web service:\n$startJSON - Looking at the start of the JSON, this section won\u0026rsquo;t change between reusable groups other than for $displayName and $description,which we can pass variables into for each. $urlJSON - For groups that contain either multiple URLs, or URLs and IPs, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to build in some logic to deal with the trailing , for the initial URL, but for now let\u0026rsquo;s ignore that and focus on just adding in the $url variable to this section of the JSON. $ipStartJSON - With IP addresses, they are all contained within a single section, similar to each URL, so we need to create the JSON structure for the start of the IP section. $ipJSON - This is where we can add our IP addresses, with one IP per section, being added to the JSON using the $ip variable. Similar to having multiple URLs, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to loop through all IP addresses and ensure that each IP has the required JSON format. $ipEndJSON - After we captured all the IP addresses, and the relevant JSON structure, we just need to tail off the full set of IP addresses with a closing structure like below. Apparently the IP address group needs an identity, which we can pass in using the variables $ipName. $endJSON - Finally to round off the full JSON structure, we need to complete the format with the required @odata.type value. In a very straightforward way, we can build out a similar JSON structure compared to the one we initially captured using the Developer Tools, but using PowerShell, combing each of the $*JSON variables.\n$displayName = \u0026#39;Test Reusable Group\u0026#39; $description = \u0026#39; My very second reusable group\u0026#39; $url = \u0026#39;*.ennbee.uk\u0026#39; $ip = \u0026#39;1.1.1.1\u0026#39; $ipsName = \u0026#39;OneOneOneOne DNS\u0026#39; $startJSON = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;displayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$displayName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$description\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingInstance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationGroupSettingCollectionInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupSettingCollectionValue\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;@ $urlJSON = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;choiceSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve_true\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [] } }, { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_keyword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;simpleSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$url\u0026#34; } } ] }, \u0026#34;@ $ipStartJSON = @\u0026#39; { \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;choiceSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationChoiceSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_autoresolve_false\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;children\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingCollectionInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_addresses\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;simpleSettingCollectionValue\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#39;@ $ipJSON = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$ip\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue\u0026#34; } \u0026#34;@ $ipEndJSON = @\u0026#34; ] } ] } }, { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSimpleSettingInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_dynamickeywords_addresses_{id}_keyword\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;simpleSettingValue\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationStringSettingValue\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$ipsName\u0026#34; } } ] } \u0026#34;@ $endJSON = @\u0026#39; ] }, \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementReusablePolicySetting\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;73d46494-6e54-4fbc-9707-e69bfef7d538\u0026#34; } \u0026#39;@ $JSON = $startJSON + $urlJSON + $ipStartJSON + $ipJSON + $ipEndJSON + $endJSON We don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about PowerShell messing around with the JSON formatting, as Graph is pretty accepting as long as what we\u0026rsquo;re submitting is a valid JSON.

Nope.\nSome network endpoints were previously published and haven\u0026rsquo;t been included in the Microsoft 365 IP Address and URL Web Service. The web service publishes network endpoints that are required for Microsoft 365 connectivity across an enterprise perimeter network.\nAdditional Network Endpoints # Not to worry, we can add any custom network endpoints and their associated URLs and IPs, and throw that at an array variable $reusableSettings, so for Microsoft Stream we\u0026rsquo;ve got something like the below.\n$reusableSettings = @() $urlsStream = @( \u0026#39;*.cloudapp.net\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;*.api.microsoftstream.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;*.notification.api.microsoftstream.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;amp.azure.net\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;api.microsoftstream.com\u0026#39; \u0026#39;az416426.vo.msecnd.net\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;s0.assets-yammer.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;vortex.data.microsoft.com\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;web.microsoftstream.com\u0026#39; ) $reusableSettings += [pscustomobject]@{displayName = \u0026#39;Microsoft Stream URLs\u0026#39;; description = \u0026#39;Network Endpoints for Microsoft Stream on TCP Ports(s) 80,443\u0026#39;; urls = $urlsStream; ips = $null; ipsName = $null } I\u0026rsquo;ve got you covered for the other network endpoints mentioned in that article that don\u0026rsquo;t exist in the web service, such as the Support and Recovery endpoints, the Windows Store, and anything else I could think of for Microsoft Intune, Windows Autopilot, and Office 365 Apps.\nMoving on swiftly.\nProcessing the Network Endpoints # With our network endpoints in the web service, and those not in the web service captured, we can now process the endpoints into something we can reuse to create the setting in Microsoft Intune. We can group these in a couple of ways.\nGrouping by Service Area # This one is easy-ish, and we can group the URLs and IP addresses by service area, ignoring any particular port requirement. So if you\u0026rsquo;re after a relatively open locked-down Windows Firewall, this one\u0026rsquo;s for you, at the end of the day, we should trust Microsoft at least a little bit.\nShort of handling the data we\u0026rsquo;ve captured and creating the variables we know we need to create the JSON content, ensuring that we\u0026rsquo;re not duplicating either URLs or IPs (Microsoft Intune will complain about duplicates if you try and do this manually, so I assume Graph will throw a wobbly too), and the wonderful kicker that is a single reusable group not having more than 100 items, we can process the data into a the $reusableSettings array variable ready for processing later.\n$reusableSettings = @() $urls = $endpointSets.urls | Sort-Object | Get-Unique $ips = $endpointSets.ips | Sort-Object | Get-Unique $name = $endpointSets.serviceAreaDisplayName | Sort-Object | Get-Unique $displayName = $name + \u0026#39; URLs and IPs\u0026#39; $description = \u0026#34;All URL and IP Network Endpoints for $name\u0026#34; $ipsName = \u0026#34;IP Addresses for $name\u0026#34; # Plus one as IPs only count as a single setting if (($urls.Count + 1) -le 100) { $reusableSettings += [pscustomobject]@{displayName = $displayName; description = $description; urls = $urls; ips = $ips; ipsName = $ipsName } } else { $displayName = $name + \u0026#39; IPs\u0026#39; $description = \u0026#34;IP Network Endpoints for $name\u0026#34; $reusableSettings += [pscustomobject]@{displayName = $displayName; description = $description; urls = $null; ips = $ips; ipsName = $ipsName } $counter = [pscustomobject] @{ Value = 0 } $groupSize = 100 $urlSubSets = $urls | Group-Object -Property { [math]::Floor($counter.Value++ / $groupSize) } foreach ($urlSubSet in $urlSubSets) { $displayName = $name + \u0026#39; URLs \u0026#39; + $urlSubSet.Name $description = \u0026#34;URL Network Endpoints for $name\u0026#34; $reusableSettings += [pscustomobject]@{displayName = $displayName; description = $description; urls = $urlSubSet.Group; ips = $null; ipsName = $null } } } I got around the 100 item limit, by punting IP addresses into one pscustomobject, and splitting the URLs into separate ones using a bit of quick maths, if the number of URLs in urls.Count plus the single IP address item is greater than 100. Sticking with my love/hate affair with Microsoft Intune, we can look at the content stored in the $reusableSettings variable for MEM.\ndisplayName : Microsoft Endpoint Manager URLs and IPs\rdescription : All URL and IP Network Endpoints for Microsoft Endpoint Manager\rurls : {*.delivery.mp.microsoft.com, *.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com, *.do.dsp.mp.microsoft.com, *.emdl.ws.microsoft.com…}\rips : {104.46.162.96/27, 13.67.13.176/28, 13.67.15.128/27, 13.69.231.128/28…}\ripsName : IP Addresses for Microsoft Endpoint Manager Perfect, we now have all we need to create reusable groups based on service, though if you\u0026rsquo;re fond of the more restrictive firewall rule keeping reading.\nGrouping by Ports # This is where it get\u0026rsquo;s a little more interesting, as you\u0026rsquo;d think there would be some consistency with the format of the string of ports contained in the tcpPorts and udpPorts values coming from the web service, there is not, so we need a way to deal with values essentially being the same, so 80, 443 and 443, 80, which, are, the, same.

Pilot - This should be a stratified sample of either users or devices, ~5% of your device estate. Pre-Production - The early adopters deployment, ~15% of your device estate. Initial Production - The first production deployment, ~30% of your device estate. Final Production - The final production deployment, the remaining ~50% of the device estate. The aim is tht the above groupings are reusable and can be used across not just Windows Updates, but Office Updates, and Driver updates too. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the membership of these groups.\nDeployment Groups # Despite Microsoft recommending to stop using the match operators in favour of startsWith there are times when you might have to ignore them, this could be one of those times when we look at how we split a device estate into the phased breakdowns we\u0026rsquo;re looking to achieve.\nAfter testing this in the real world, with reset Autopilot Hybrid join devices, you end up with a little bit of conflict on group membership due to there being two computer objects in Entra.\nTo avoid this, I\u0026rsquo;ve added in (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) to the group rules, only capturing those devices that are actually enrolled in Microsoft Intune.\nInefficient Dynamic Groups # For the members of Test and Pilot groups, these should be targeted members, not just any old device, so ensure you populate these groups with true test devices, and suitable pilot devices for update testing.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll notice that this time we\u0026rsquo;re using Dynamic Groups across all the pre-production and production groups, and using a new attribute of deviceId, which is a wonderful UUID associated with all Entra computer objects, and it being a UUID gives us a nice split of devices based on the queries used.\nGroup Type Membership Test Group Assigned TBC Pilot Group Assigned TBC Pre-Production Group Dynamic Device (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceId -match \u0026quot;^[0-1,a]\u0026quot;) Initial Production Group Dynamic Device (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceId -match \u0026quot;^[2-4,b-c]\u0026quot;) Final Production Group Dynamic Device (device.deviceManagementAppId -ne null) and (device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;) and (device.deviceId -match \u0026quot;^[5-9,d-f]\u0026quot;) With the start of the deviceId only ever being in the range of 0-9 or a-f we\u0026rsquo;ve an easy way to split our devices across the three production level groups, and ensure that we are capturing all devices, using the match operator, and the regular expression similar to ^[0-9,a-f] to detect whether the deviceId starts with one of the values in the ranges provided.\nYou may want to tweak the rules used here, to alter the size of each of the production groups, by changing the range of the ^[0-9,a-f] query.

Phased Office Updates # With a similar approach to the Windows Update Rings, we can create corresponding Settings Catalog profiles for our five deployment phases, aligning as best we can the end result, which is installed updates, to the restart of the updates delivered as part of the Windows Update ring configuration.\nAll settings exist under the same category as before, Microsoft Office 2016 (Machine) \u0026gt; Updates.\nUpdate Ring Delay downloading and installing updates for Office Days: (Device) Update Deadline Deadline: (Device) Updates Installed Test Enabled 0 Enabled 1 After 1 day, Wednesday Pilot Enabled 2 Enabled 1 After 3 days, Friday Pre-Production Enabled 5 Enabled 2 After 7 days, Tuesday Initial Production Enabled 8 Enabled 2 After 10 days, Friday Final Production Enabled 11 Enabled 3 After 14 days, Tuesday As Office Updates are released with the same update cadence as our normal updates on a \u0026lsquo;Patch Tuesday\u0026rsquo;, then the installation time falls on the same days, meaning that all updates should be installed and the device restarted on the same day, reducing overall disruption to the users.\nUpdate Ring Assignment # After creating the Windows Update Rings, and our faux Office Update Rings using the above settings, we cover how we assign our phased deployment groups to each suitable Update Ring.\nFeel free to alter the deferral, deadline, and grace periods where applicable to your device estate, but please if you want the experience to be as expected, use the below assignment targets. Update Ring Included Groups Excluded Groups Test Test Group - Pilot Pilot Group Test Group Pre-Production Pre-Production Group Test Group, Pilot Group Initial Production Initial Production Group Test Group, Pilot Group Final Production Final Production Group Test Group, Pilot Group I\u0026rsquo;m assuming here that you aren\u0026rsquo;t putting VIP user devices in Test and Pilot, because you don\u0026rsquo;t want to anger them, maybe do it on your last day .\nThis is an improvement on our previous version of Update Ring assignment, as we\u0026rsquo;re not relying on excludes and dynamic groups to update to ensure there are no conflicts. VIP Ring Assignment # To get the expected behaviour for our VIP groups, we need to consider what happens when we want to ensure a VIP device is in the correct Update Ring, which includes making sure there are no conflicts across the rings.\nChanging the assignments of our Update Rings to the below, will allow for the manual assignment based on a devices VIP group membership.\nUpdate Ring Included Groups Excluded Groups Test Test Group - Pilot Pilot Group Test Group Pre-Production Pre-Production Group, VIP Pre-Production Test Group, Pilot Group, VIP Initial Production, VIP Final Production Initial Production Initial-Production Group, VIP Initial-Production Test Group, Pilot Group, VIP Pre-Production, VIP Final Production Final Production Final Production, VIP Final Production Test Group, Pilot Group, VIP Pre-Production, VIP Initial Production For example if device name VIP-7wa7f4c35, with deviceId ec759183-4492-44f4-a2ec-dbc33470bf48 (which will captured by the \u0026lsquo;Final Production\u0026rsquo; dynamic group), is added to group VIP Initial Production, it will exclude the device from the \u0026lsquo;Final Production\u0026rsquo; Update Ring, and assign the Update Ring for \u0026lsquo;Initial Production\u0026rsquo;, with the device restarting after updates on a Friday.\nAdding in not only new include assignments, but exclude assignments, will ensure that devices in these groups are assigned to the correct Update Ring.\nSummary # All of this should give you the option to not only suitably phase Windows, Microsoft, and Office Updates, with each subsequent Update Ring starting only after the next, but also allow the shift of devices around without conflict, whether this is for VIP users or otherwise.\nIt also provides your end users with clear details of the days of when their device will not only get updated, but also restart, without too much of a headache, or interruption to their casual personal use of their corporate owned device.\n","date":"19 February 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/flexible-update-deployments/","section":"Posts","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since we\u0026rsquo;ve looked at deploying Microsoft and Windows Updates using Microsoft Intune, this time we look at different ways to phase our deployments across a device estate.","title":"A Flexible Approach to Microsoft Update Deployments","type":"posts"},{"content":"This isn\u0026rsquo;t the first time we\u0026rsquo;ve looked at deploying backgrounds for Microsoft Teams on macOS, but it\u0026rsquo;s been a while since we answered an internet strangers question, and hopefully my scripting has come on a little way since then (spoiler: it hasn\u0026rsquo;t).\nNow that the \u0026lsquo;New\u0026rsquo; Microsoft Teams app is the de facto version available to download from Microsoft replacing the \u0026lsquo;Classic\u0026rsquo; one, we should at least look at how it handles uploaded backgrounds and if required update our existing script to support not only the \u0026lsquo;Classic\u0026rsquo; version, but the \u0026lsquo;New\u0026rsquo; version too.\nApplication Differences # Before we go digging into the existing script to work out what has broken with the new version of app, we should check to see what, if any differences there are across both version for the purpose of our script.\nUploaded Background Locations # Digging around the internet, and on a macOS device with both apps installed, we can see that uploaded backgrounds from the client itself are stored in the below locations:\nClassic App - $HOME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads New App - $HOME/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.teams2/Data/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/MSTeams/Backgrounds/Uploads So this is similar to the change in uploaded background location for the Windows version that Florian Salzmann found in their post about updating backgrounds for the new Windows Teams client.\nApplication Name # Another thing to note, is how we were detecting whether the Teams app was installed, referencing the app name, which has also changed, only slightly though but it is still a change:\nClassic App - Microsoft Teams classic.app New App - Microsoft Teams (work or school).app Great, so we need to take into account the file path change, and the app name change.

Remediation Methods # As we have a good understanding following the implementation of the report only style Remediation, we can now investigate how best to actually fix the issue. For this, we can take the existing script by u/InternetStranger4You and modifying it to support the required exit codes for Microsoft Intune.\nScript Breakdown # The script itself is taking the manual steps detailed by Microsoft in KB5028997, and wrapping them nicely in PowerShell, but I\u0026rsquo;ll walk through the settings so we\u0026rsquo;re all on the same page:\nEnsures that the script can read the contents of the reagentc.exe command by capture the output of the process using New-Object System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo as the output data is used throughout the script. Checks if there is anything wrong with WinRE with if (($stdout.IndexOf('harddisk') -ne -1) -and ($stdout.IndexOf('partition') -ne -1)), and if so exits. Disables the recovery environment Start-Process 'reagentc.exe' -ArgumentList '/disable' -Wait -NoNewWindow to allow for modification to the partition. Captures information about the Disk the Recovery partition sits on, and the partition itself.

All of these settings are exactly as per the Microsoft provided document, but you know, done for you.\nNow We Attack # To allow the script to work within a Remediation, we need to ensure that the data being passed back to Microsoft Intune is suitable, and other that wrapping the bulk of the script in some Try and Catch logic, and handling the output of the commands with Write-Output and corresponding Exit codes, there isn\u0026rsquo;t a whole heap for us to do thankfully.\n#Script to fix the recovery partition for KB5028997 by /u/InternetStranger4You, updated by Nick Benton #Mostly Powershell version of Microsoft\u0026#39;s support article: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5028997-instructions-to-manually-resize-your-partition-to-install-the-winre-update-400faa27-9343-461c-ada9-24c8229763bf #Test in your own environment before running.

All is left to do now, is find some more test devices to add to the assignment group, and monitor their progress.\nSummary # In short, this should allow you to get over the hurdle caused by the failing update delivery, and also give the devices with the issue a push in the right direction following the update to their recovery partition size, to allow them to realise they can now install the update. I can\u0026rsquo;t take credit for the scripting of the Microsoft published resolution, that goes to u/InternetStranger4You, but with this and moving it to a Remediation in Microsoft Intune, means that it can do the heavy lifting on your behalf.\nOr you can just wait for Microsoft to release a fix, totally up to you.\nThanks to piotrxj in the comments for the updated detection method.\nI hold no responsibility for the impact to your devices or environments, please, please, please test this on devices you do not care about first before even contemplating pushing this to a wider audience.

Follow the manual steps provided by Microsoft or blindly follow a script created by a stranger on the internet?","title":"Automatically Resizing the WinRE Partition for Windows Update KB5034441","type":"posts"},{"content":"Imagine you\u0026rsquo;ve spent time getting your Windows devices enrolled into Intune, they\u0026rsquo;re all getting Device Compliance policies, and you\u0026rsquo;ve finally pulled the trigger on your shiny new Conditional Access Policy that require device compliance for all your users across Windows devices, and low and behold, you\u0026rsquo;ve broken access to Microsoft 365 authenticated services from your Remote Desktop service environment, or even VDI environments.\nSo what next? Use the trusted location exemption in your policy for the virtual environment? What happens if the public facing address range is the same as your workstation environments or that you\u0026rsquo;d rather not blow a massive hole in security by allowing an entire IP address range free access to Microsoft 365 authenticated services? That\u0026rsquo;s not very Zero Trust of you is it.\nFiltering Devices # Luckily within the the Conditional Access Policy configuration, there is a way to filter devices based on the device object registered with Entra ID, there are some useful native device attributes that can be used as long as your devices have registered in Entra ID (think Hybrid Entra Joined for this VDI environment).\nWhat happens when you can\u0026rsquo;t find a suitable attribute to use that excludes your virtual environment, but still includes your end user computer workstations? The answer here are the attributes extensionAttribute1-15, which are attributes attached only to the Entra ID device object, and not synchronised, and require specific permissions to set using Graph. These seem like a good way to go.\nGetting Attributes # For us to understand how these attributes can be updated or added, we\u0026rsquo;d probably best take a look at how we see the attributes in the first place. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with a device in Entra ID, we can see from the below where these attributes should be:\nAn Entra ID Windows device. Currently this device has no attributes assigned, shock. We\u0026rsquo;ll need the Object ID in a second, so may as well grab it now.\nWhat about using Graph? We can pull back these attributes by querying the device itself, using a GET to https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/{objectId}/, so for this device the call is https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/492a52d0-ec1a-40ed-8ea5-79f27aa0f8bf/.\nGraph Explorer showing empty device attributes. Yup still no attributes.\nAdding Attributes # Now that we can see where these attributes reside on the device object in Entra ID, if we\u0026rsquo;re going to be using them as a filtering option in our Conditional Access Policy, we should probably have a look at how we update them.\nPretty straight forward, as it\u0026rsquo;s the device object we\u0026rsquo;re updating, we can create, remove, or replace these attributes using a PATCH to the same Graph endpoint https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/492a52d0-ec1a-40ed-8ea5-79f27aa0f8bf/ using the JSON format in the documentation and like the example below.\n{ \u0026#34;extensionAttributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;extensionAttribute1\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m an Attribute\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extensionAttribute2\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m also an Attribute\u0026#34; } } Punting the above to the device using Graph Explorer, we get the expected response of {} which is always pleasant, and querying the device object again with a GET, we can now see the attributes updated.\nGraph Explorer showing a new device attribute. We\u0026rsquo;re onto something here.\nUpdating or Removing Attributes # We need to be careful with our PATCH calls to the device object, as they will update the attributes, this means removal and update of existing attributes, you can see using the below example that we can change extensionAttribute1 and just plain remove extensionAttribute2.\n{ \u0026#34;extensionAttributes\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;extensionAttribute1\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;CAP-00-Out\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;extensionAttribute2\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } } Now the device object is an attribute crisis.\nGraph Explorer showing updated device attributes. I\u0026rsquo;ve given the attribute a sensible value of CAP-00-Out as we can utilise the range of operators available in the Conditional Access Policy device filter for the attributes.\nFilter for Devices # So now we have a way to essentially tag devices we want to exclude from a Conditional Access Policy, we should look at how we create a device filter, and also explore the fact we can build a naming convention with these \u0026ldquo;tags\u0026rdquo; and utilise the operators available.\nYou have to be careful with filtering within Conditional Access Policies, as there is some level of logic over not only supported operators, but also the attributes that use the operators, and how they are evaluated.\nFor our scenario, we\u0026rsquo;re going to use extensionAttributes which as of today, support the following operators Equals, NotEquals, StartsWith, NotStartsWith, EndsWith, NotEndsWith, Contains, NotContains, In, NotIn\nSo building a quick query in the policy, we can exclude devices where extensionAttribute1 equals CAP-00-Out.\nConditional Access Policy filter using the equals operator. Or if we want to be clever and capture devices where where extensionAttribute1 ends in Out regardless of the other content.\nConditional Access Policy filter using the ends with operator. So there is value in coming up with good naming conventions across all areas of Entra ID and Microsoft Intune, who knew?\nFiltering in Action # Having created a Conditional Access Policy in Report-only mode to Require device to be marked as compliant or Require Microsoft Entra hybrid joined device on Windows device platforms, with the filter to exclude devices matching device.extensionAttribute1 -eq \u0026quot;CAP-00-Out\u0026quot;, we can see in the sign in logs for the user in scope of the policy, when accessing Microsoft 365 authenticated resources, that they are not subject to the policy.\nUser sign in logs in Entra ID. Which for our situation is exactly the outcome we\u0026rsquo;re after. Now time to make this less of a manual process.\nPowerShell and Graph # I\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with authenticating to Graph, and this time instead of the trusty MSAL.PS module I\u0026rsquo;m using Microsoft the native commands, ikr, shocking. Now that we\u0026rsquo;re connected to Graph with the required scope options using Connect-MgGraph -Scopes 'Device.ReadWrite.All', we need to be able to pull back all the devices we want to assign an attribute to.\nGetting Devices # Who knew that when working in non-development tenants that you\u0026rsquo;d have to consider pagination, so yeah, I had to throw something together to pull back all Entra ID device objects using the very same Graph endpoint we used earlier to look at a single device https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/devices/ and the Invoke-MgGraphRequest command.\nFunction Get-DeviceAAD() { $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#39;devices\u0026#39; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$Resource\u0026#34; $GraphResults = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri $uri $Results = @() $Results += $GraphResults.value $Pages = $GraphResults.\u0026#39;@odata.nextLink\u0026#39; while ($null -ne $Pages) { $Additional = Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Method GET -Uri $Pages if ($Pages) { $Pages = $Additional.\u0026#39;@odata.nextLink\u0026#39; } $Results += $Additional.value } $Results } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } For the pagination, we\u0026rsquo;re capturing the results of the web request into an array variable $Results, and looping through the @odata.nextLink data with a subsequent Graph calls, adding each result back into the same array variable until there are no more results. Simple right?\nRunning this will allow us to pull back all Entra ID device objects, and with the below we can present them in a table using Out-GridView.\n$Devices = @(Get-DeviceAAD | Select-Object displayName, operatingSystem, manufacturer, model, id, deviceId | Out-GridView -PassThru -Title \u0026#39;Select Devices to update extension attributes...\u0026#39;) Allowing the selection of the devices that need their extension attributes updating, and importantly the id of the device object used to update the attribute.\nThe PowerShell script grid view for Entra ID devices.

Compared with the legacy profiles maximum of 150, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to split out the rules in $FWRules into 100 rule groups to allow us to add them to a single policy.\n$counter = [pscustomobject] @{ Value = 0 } $groupSize = 100 $FWRuleGroups = $FWRules | Group-Object -Property { [math]::Floor($counter.Value++ / $groupSize) } With the above, we can ensure that we are breaking the rules into 100 rule sections that we can then reference using the $FWRuleGroups variable when building the new policies.\nCount Name Group ----- ---- ----- 100 0 {@{displayName=Wi-Fi Direct Spooler Use (Out); description=Outbound rule to use WSD printers on Wi-Fi Direct networks.; trafficDirection=out; 100 1 {@{displayName=Network Discovery (SSDP-In); description=Inbound rule for Network Discovery to allow use of the Simple Service Discovery Protocol.

So I had at least an idea on how to build the JSON data to throw it at Microsoft Intune.\nBuilding the Policy # With the rules in neat little groups, and with all the variables in place, we can loop through each of them to create individual Settings Catalog policies, we need to make sure that each policy has a unique name, so we can just take an existing $PolicyName variable and append the group name to it, as these are sequential numbers, giving us something like COPE_FW_RulesMigrated-0, COPE_FW_RulesMigrated-1, COPE_FW_RulesMigrated-2, COPE_FW_RulesMigrated-3, COPE_FW_RulesMigrated-4 for the five groups we have in our example.\nEach Settings Catalog Policy starts and ends with the same JSON data structure, so we can top and tail each policy with these new variables $JSONPolicyStart and $JSONPolicyEnd, passing in the $NewPolicyName and $PolicyDescription.\nforeach ($FWRuleGroup in $FWRuleGroups) { $NewPolicyName = $PolicyName + \u0026#39;-\u0026#39; + $FWRuleGroup.Name $PolicyDescription = \u0026#39;Migrated Firewall Rules Policy\u0026#39; $JSONPolicyStart = @\u0026#34; { \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$PolicyDescription\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$NewPolicyName\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;platforms\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;windows10\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;technologies@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationTechnologies\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;technologies\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;mdm,microsoftSense\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationPolicyTemplateReference\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;19c8aa67-f286-4861-9aa0-f23541d31680_1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateFamily@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationTemplateFamily\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateFamily\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;endpointSecurityFirewall\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateDisplayName\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft Defender Firewall Rules\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;templateDisplayVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Version 1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSetting\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingInstance\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationGroupSettingCollectionInstance\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingDefinitionId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;vendor_msft_firewall_mdmstore_firewallrules_{firewallrulename}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingInstanceTemplateReference\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationSettingInstanceTemplateReference\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;settingInstanceTemplateId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;76c7a8be-67d2-44bf-81a5-38c94926b1a1\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;groupSettingCollectionValue@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#Collection(microsoft.graph.deviceManagementConfigurationGroupSettingValue)\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupSettingCollectionValue\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;@ $JSONPolicyEnd = @\u0026#39; ] } } ] } \u0026#39;@ } This was the easy part of the process, we now need to focus on the rules themselves.\nBuilding the Rules # As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned before, the initial rule in each policy has different JSON structure and data than the rest, so we can reuse our previous way of dealing this checking whether the rule is the first in the array.\nif ($Rule -eq $Rules[0]) { ... } else { ... } On top of this we need to build in logic to only add in JSON data when the rule requires it.

Let\u0026rsquo;s have a gander at comparing the rules between the profiles, with the old profile looking like the below with the rule detail.\nLegacy Firewall Rule policy settings in Microsoft Intune. And the new policy looking pretty damn good.\nNew Firewall Rule policy settings in Microsoft Intune. I think we\u0026rsquo;re done.\nSummary # This, and the script, as usual all came about from improving a Customers Microsoft Intune environment. The customer being very security focussed was blocking legitimately everything inbound and outbound unless there was a firewall rule; this included all Microsoft 365 endpoints.\nWith their existing rules in legacy profiles, they had to have rules with all the IP addresses for these Microsoft endpoints, and keep these up-to-date across multiple profiles.\nThis obviously wasn\u0026rsquo;t ideal, and with the advent of the reusable settings and the auto discovery of addresses and domains for firewall rules in Settings Catalog policies, allowed for more confidence in the rules, a reduced maintenance overhead, and you know, new stuff is cool.\nThere is still a scenario I need to look at, and I mentioned that at the start, looking at the original Microsoft Rule Migration Tool and getting that to create Settings Catalog policies instead of the legacy format, but that is one for a very very rainy day.\n","date":"12 September 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/settings-catalog-firewall-rules/","section":"Posts","summary":"If you\u0026rsquo;ve ever experienced the joys of migrating Group Policy and in particular Windows Defender Firewall rules away from Group Policy to Microsoft Intune, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably encountered the Rule Migration Tool, and for now this tool has worked well. So what\u0026rsquo;s the catch?","title":"Modernising Microsoft Intune Firewall Rule Policies","type":"posts"},{"content":"You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune.\nWith Configuration Manager having the backing of Microsoft SQL, and a hardware inventory that collects every granular detail about Windows devices, splitting out your device estate into logical phases is very easy to achieve.\nBut what about Microsoft Intune, how do we phase these updates in a similar way to Configuration Manager?\nWindows Update for Business Rings # The first thing we need to understand is how many WUfB (Windows Update for Business) rings we should create, usually based on the size of your Windows device estate, for now we\u0026rsquo;ll stick with four update rings:\nTesting Ring: This should be devices that are dedicated for testing, not IT machines. Roughly 5% of your device estate. Pilot Ring: This should be a stratified sample of either users or devices, not friends and family (HR and Finance). Roughly 15% of your device estate. Initial Production Ring: This should be roughly half of the remaining devices, roughly 30% of your device estate. Final Production Ring: This should cover all remaining devices, so 50% of the device estate. These rings can be created in Microsoft Intune with differing deferral periods, installation deadlines, and if you like, grace periods.\nInstallation Settings # Taking the Update Rings above, we should ensure that the end result of deferral, deadlines, and grace periods is that that there is no crossover between the timings. What I mean is that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to discover an issue with devices in the Pilot Ring after the Initial Production Ring has already started deploying updates, this sounds like a nightmare.\nSo we can use settings similar to those in the below table to ensure that one phase doesn\u0026rsquo;t start until the previous has completed.\nUpdate Ring Deferral Deadline Grace Period Updates Installed Testing Ring 0 days 1 day 0 days 1 day Pilot Ring 2 days 1 day 1 day 4 days Initial Production Ring 6 days 2 days 1 day 9 days Final Production Ring 10 days 2 days 1 day 13 days You may have noticed that we\u0026rsquo;re working within a 14-day window here, because we all love NCSC Guidelines. So with the Update Rings configured, we now need to look at how these are assigned to Users and Devices.\nUsers versus Devices Assignment # Now assignment of Update Rings is no different to any other assignment in Microsoft Intune, and by that I mean that you cannot mix assignment target identities within Include and Exclude targets. We do also need to consider not just the individual Update Ring assignment, but how they all interact together. What we don\u0026rsquo;t want is a device meant to be in the Final Production ring, getting a 0-day deferral because the user is in the Testing Ring.\nSo we should stick with assigning these rings to a single identity, but which one?\nI mean, the answer is Devices, but I\u0026rsquo;ll explain why.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re using Users, which seems like the easier approach as finding and managing pilot users is pretty straight forward, it means that the Update Ring will follow them regardless of which device they login to. This is not the functionality we want, updates are delivered to devices, not users, so let\u0026rsquo;s see how we can group devices together in a sensible way.\nUpdate Ring Groups # So now we need to find a way group devices in a sensible way, so let\u0026rsquo;s create three (yes three) new Azure AD Microsoft Entra ID Security Groups for each of the Update Rings.\nWindows Updates Testing Windows Updates Pilot Windows Updates Initial Production With both the Testing and Pilot ring being specifically designated devices, we can use Assigned Groups and add Windows devices to each of those groups, what are we doing with the \u0026lsquo;Windows Updates Initial Production\u0026rsquo; group though?\nDynamic Groups # Now I know I love Device Filters, and do not fear, we\u0026rsquo;ll need one of these later, but as covered previously Dynamic Groups are more powerful, and for this use case will perfectly fit our need to split our Windows device estate in half-ish.\nDevice Name is how we\u0026rsquo;re going to split our device estate, whether these are you old-school naming conventions on-premises based on asset tag, serial number or otherwise, Autopilot Azure AD Join MEID Join (really?) devices with a prefix and a serial, or god forbid Autopilot Hybrid Joined devices with a prefix and random numbers.\nEither way, we should be able use Dynamic Device Groups to capture half of the device estate.\nStart of Device Name Matching # Before we look at how we capture the devices let\u0026rsquo;s look at some device name examples starting with a list of devices with a mixture of device names.\nENB-BDZX4M3 ENB-3231EQSM PGT-45E8LN1S VIP-ec9d473986d9 ITS-CRJ7C39 CON-f6f64b04a9e7 As we have some kind of naming convention here with a three letter prefix follow by a hyphen and then some random characters, we should be able to capture half of the devices by pulling back only devices that after the hyphen start with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), or alternate letters (a, c, e, etc.).\nThrowing open you\u0026rsquo;re favourite RegEx tester we can plonk in the device names and start playing with queries, and if we want to be exact so we only capture devices that match our three character prefix followed by a hyphen and an odd number, we can use an expression like this.\n^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[13579] For capturing devices that match the three character prefix followed by a hyphen and alternative lowercase characters, we can use the expression below.\n^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[acegikmoqsuwy] For capturing devices that match the three character prefix followed by a hyphen and alternative uppercase characters, we can use the expression below.\n^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[ACEGIKMOQSUWY] To give you an insight into the expression:\n^: Start of the string [a-zA-Z]{3}-: First three characters are either uppercase or lowercase letters followed by a hyphen d*[13579]: One odd number d*[acegikmoqsuwy]: One alternative lowercase letter from the supplied range d*[ACEGIKMOQSUWY]: One alternative uppercase letter from the supplied range This should cover our requirements, we just need to create the Dynamic Group query.\nEnd of Device Name Matching # What happens if you\u0026rsquo;re still using asset tag naming conventions, most of these devices will all start with the same letter or number, so we need a way to split these in a different way.\nLooking at the sample device list below, we can create a new expression that looks at the last number of the device name, but taking into consideration the prefix, hyphen, and only the following six digits.\nLTP-002003 LTP-002042 DTP-001191 DTP-000117 LTP-000008 Once again into RegEx testing we can plonk in the device names and start playing with queries, this time we just want to match devices with any three character prefix followed by a hyphen, but end in an odd number.\n^[a-zA-Z]{3}-\\d{5}[13579]$ An overview of the expression:\n^: Start of the string [a-zA-Z]{3}-: First three characters are either uppercase or lowercase letters followed by a hyphen \\d{5}: Matches five digits after the hyphen [13579]$: The sixth digit is odd This should work for the sample asset tag named devices.\nDynamic Group Query # As well as the using one of the above name matching expressions, we could do with capturing whether the device is actually a Windows Corporate-Owned device.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s build our Dynamic Group Query based on the below requirements.\n(device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026quot;Windows\u0026quot;): Any Windows Device (device.deviceOSVersion -startsWith \u0026quot;10\u0026quot;): Any device with an Operating System that starts with 10 (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Company\u0026quot;): Any device that is corporate owned ((device.displayName -match \u0026quot;^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[13579]\u0026quot;): Device name matches our naming convention followed by an odd number (device.displayName -match \u0026quot;^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[acegikmoqsuwy]\u0026quot;): Device name matches our naming convention followed by a lowercase letter in the set (device.displayName -match \u0026quot;^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[ACEGIKMOQSUWY]\u0026quot;)): Device name matches our naming convention followed by a uppercase letter in the set We need to throw in some and and or into the mix to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re only grabbing the correct devices, but the full query can be found below.\n(device.deviceOSType -eq \u0026#34;Windows\u0026#34;) and (device.deviceOSVersion -startsWith \u0026#34;10\u0026#34;) and (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026#34;Company\u0026#34;) and ((device.displayName -match \u0026#34;^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[13579]\u0026#34;) or (device.displayName -match \u0026#34;^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[acegikmoqsuwy]\u0026#34;) or (device.displayName -match \u0026#34;^[a-zA-Z]{3}-d*[ACEGIKMOQSUWY]\u0026#34;)) Using our sample of devices names, the above query would capture the highlighted names below.\nENB-BDZX4M3 ENB-3231EQSM PGT-45E8LN1S VIP-ec9d473986d9 ITS-CRJ7C39 CON-f6f64b04a9e7 Expanding this over an entire device estate should give us roughly half of all Windows 10 and later corporate owned devices.\nUpdate Ring Assignment # So have pretty much all we need to actually start assigning our Update Rings to device groups, but hang fire, we\u0026rsquo;ve only created three groups and have four Update Rings, what gives?\nWell for the final ring, we need to cover all remaining Windows corporate owned devices, so we can use the built-in \u0026lsquo;All Devices\u0026rsquo; group and a Device Filter that only pulls back corporate owned devices, so something like (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Corporate\u0026quot;).\nNow we can start assigning, but we need to make sure that there is no conflict with the profiles, so we\u0026rsquo;ll make use of both Include and Exclude assignment targets, detailed in the table below.\nUpdate Ring Include Group Filter Mode Exclude Groups Testing Ring Windows Updates Testing n/a n/a n/a Pilot Ring Windows Updates Pilot n/a n/a Windows Updates Testing Initial Production Ring Windows Updates Initial Production n/a n/a Windows Updates Testing, Windows Updates Pilot Final Production Ring All Devices Corporate Windows Include Windows Updates Testing, Windows Updates Pilot, Windows Updates Initial Production Once you\u0026rsquo;ve assigned the Update Rings and confirmed that devices are receiving the correct one, you\u0026rsquo;re good to go. Simple really.\nSummary # There you have it, a phased and self maintaining deployment of Windows Updates across your device estate, allowing you to truly control when devices are getting updates and an ability to pause update rings in the event of an issue without taking out all of your device estate at once.\nObviously you can tailor the number of Update Rings and logic behind splitting devices across them, but it was hard enough for me to work out the RegEx for these two examples to be honest with you.\nI\u0026rsquo;d suggest you start with understanding what devices you need to target, their naming conventions if any, and then play around with RegEx to ensure that you are capturing the correct devices, no one wants unexpected Windows Updates.\nOnce happy with your expressions, you can then create the Dynamic Group and review the membership before going all gung ho and straight up assigning the Update Ring profile to the group, you know, just in case.\n","date":"17 July 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-update-phased-deployment/","section":"Posts","summary":"You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune..","title":"Intelligent Phased Windows Update for Business Deployments","type":"posts"},{"content":"We looked at some of the ways to secure macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, aligned with the NCSC platform guidance in macOS National Cyber Security Centre Security Settings in Intune, but this was when macOS device management in Intune was, at best, in beta.\nGeneral hardening has been covered previously by Hubert Maslowski in their post that covers device compliance and configuration settings, but we\u0026rsquo;re looking at ensuring that the macOS devices meet the National Cyber Security Centre settings, including Cyber Essentials requirements.\nNow with the additional macOS settings, and new macOS versions, I thought we should look at how we can now secure these enrolled devices aligned to these known good practice settings.\nNCSC Guidelines # Handily, NCSC provide a list of their recommendations for macOS device security, and unlike our previous attempt at hardening, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to rely on mobileconfig custom settings to deliver these hardening requirements.\nThe settings from the platform guidance we\u0026rsquo;ll cover in this post are as detailed in the sections below.

When a compliance policy contains password restrictions, this will force the end user to change their password at next logon, and result in any attempt at elevation to fail with existing credentials until the password has been updated. \u0026hellip;and a device restrictions profile to meet these requirements.\nMicrosoft Intune macOS configuration profile for passwords.

For the Device Restriction Profile we can cover the restriction below.\nShow only Name and Password Text fields Microsoft Intune macOS configuration profile for login settings. Software Updates # Ah yes, software updates, basically we need to ensure that updates are installed within a 14-day window from the release of the update, that the updates can be installed by the end user, and that only production updates can be installed.\nAutomatically install macOS updates Allow non-admin users to install software updates Do not defer macOS Updates Allow installation of macOS beta releases With these requirements we can create the Settings Catalog profile below to adhere to the restrictions.\nMicrosoft Intune macOS configuration profile for software update settings.

The excerpt from the NCSC guide is as follows.\nDisable iCloud Profiles Disable Security \u0026amp; Privacy Disable Startup Disk Disable Sharing (enables remote management) Disable Siri Disable Xsan (If not in use) Disable FibreChannel (if not in use). We can now use a Settings Catalog profile to hide these system preference panes, using the Apple Developer Reference as a reference for each of these system preferences, allowing us to restrict the following areas:\nSystem Preference Value iCloud Profiles com.apple.preferences.icloud Security and Privacy com.apple.preference.security Startup Disk com.apple.preference.startupdisk Sharing com.apple.preferences.sharing Siri com.apple.Siri-Settings.extension Xsan com.apple.Xsan FibreChannel com.apple.prefpanel.fibrechannel With this we can create a new profile using the Disabled Preference Panes option.\nMicrosoft Intune macOS configuration profile for system preferences. This will then disable these panes on the device for the end user, stopping them adding iCloud accounts, configuring sharing settings include remote control, along with other NCSC deemed risky areas on the macOS device.\nTime Server Configuration # This one is nice and easy, and a lot easier to handle now in Intune, without the need to create a new mobileconfig file, we can just throw both the time zone and time servers into the same Settings Catalog profile as per the requirement below.\nSpecify time server by device location Ensure that you are selecting location specific time servers, in this instance we\u0026rsquo;re in the UK so using the UK servers from the NTP Pool Project, you may want to configure your own servers, but remember these devices may not always be on your local corporate network.\nMicrosoft Intune macOS configuration profile for time zone settings.

Assignment Overview # Assigning Settings Catalog profiles for Windows, macOS, and iOS/iPadOS devices isn\u0026rsquo;t anything new, though Settings Catalogs were a bit of a revelation when they first appeared in Microsoft Intune allowing you to build profiles from scratch with a searchable interface, and with the ability to assign them to groups and use Device Filters, I jumped at the chance to use them in place of custom profiles where applicable.\nWhat about the assignment though, what does that look like?\nAssignment Restrictions # Settings Catalog assignment isn\u0026rsquo;t too dissimilar from assigning any other profile type, though as you\u0026rsquo;ll discover through subsequent posts, each has it\u0026rsquo;s own nuance when it comes to how you assign the profiles. So let\u0026rsquo;s list what we can do when it comes to assignment, and what we can\u0026rsquo;t do, as this will shape how we build out a PowerShell function to allow us to assign profiles in bulk.\nAssignment Wins # These assignments, if already familiar with Microsoft Intune, shouldn\u0026rsquo;t come as any surprise:\nIncluded Groups: Assigning to All Devices, All Users, and Groups of Devices or Users Included Groups: Assigning to All Devices with an Include Device Filter, All Users with an Include Device Filter, and Groups of Devices or Users with an Include Device Filter Included Groups: Assigning to All Devices with an Exclude Device Filter, All Users with an Exclude Device Filter, and Groups of Devices or Users with an Exclude Device Filter Excluded Groups: Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users Remember that when excluding groups, you cannot mix user and device groups across include and exclude. So this is pretty useful and should, especially with Device Filters, be all you need for assignment. What about the things we can\u0026rsquo;t do?\nAssignment No-nos # The list below is the current list of things you cannot do with the assignments for Settings Catalogs, and takes into consideration whether there are existing assignments on the profile:\nIncluded Groups: Assigning to All Devices and a Group of Devices or Users Included Groups: Assigning to All Users and a Group of Devices or Users Included Groups: Assigning to a Group that already has an assignment Included Groups: Assigning to All Devices that already has an assignment Included Groups: Assigning to All Users that already has an assignment Included Groups: Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users if All Devices already has an assignment Included Groups: Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users if All Users already has an assignment Excluded Groups: Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users with any Device Filter Excluded Groups: Assigning to All Devices or All Users Excluded Groups: Assigning to a Group that already has an assignment There are many restrictions when it comes to adding additional assignments, the above are the important ones, as we don\u0026rsquo;t want to be creating ourselves issues with assignments later on. Though this is going to give me a headache writing PowerShell to deal with this logic.\nGetting Settings Catalog Information # We\u0026rsquo;ve now got a good grip on the methods for assignment, but to start this all off, we need a way to get both the the Settings Catalog profile itself, a method to capture all existing assignments, and importantly, how to add assignments to the profile.\nGetting Settings Catalogs # I already had the PowerShell function below at my disposal, so after connecting to Graph API using Connect-MgGraph and the Graph PowerShell SDK module, we can use the deviceManagementConfigurationPolicy endpoint in the below function to pull back either all Settings Catalogs, or specific ones using either the Id or Name.\nFunction Get-DeviceSettingsCatalog() { [cmdletbinding()] param ( [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)] $Name, [Parameter(Mandatory = $false)] $Id ) $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#34;deviceManagement/configurationPolicies?`$filter=technologies has \u0026#39;mdm\u0026#39;\u0026#34; try { if ($Id) { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$Resource/$Id\u0026#34; Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get } elseif ($Name) { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get).Value | Where-Object { ($_.Name).contains(\u0026#34;$Name\u0026#34;) } } Else { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get).Value } } catch { $exs = $Error.ErrorDetails $ex = $exs[0] Write-Host \u0026#34;Response content:`n$ex\u0026#34; Write-Host \u0026#34;Request to $Uri failed with HTTP Status $($ex.Message)\u0026#34; Break } } Running this function will get us the information we need in the Id of the Setting Catalog profile.\ncreatedDateTime : 08/03/2023 13:39:14 creationSource : description : lastModifiedDateTime : 10/05/2023 08:40:16 name : Corporate_Configuration_Policy_Conflict platforms : windows10 priorityMetaData : roleScopeTagIds : {0} settingCount : 1 technologies : mdm id : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5 templateReference : @{templateId=; templateFamily=none; templateDisplayName=; templateDisplayVersion=} With a way to get a Settings Catalog profile, we now need a way to pull back any and all assignments for a profile using the deviceManagementConfigurationPolicyAssignments endpoint in Graph and the above Id of the profile.\nGetting Settings Catalog Assignments # Function Get-DeviceSettingsCatalogAssignment() { [cmdletbinding()] param ( [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $Id ) $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;Beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#34;deviceManagement/configurationPolicies/$Id/assignments\u0026#34; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get).value } catch { $exs = $Error.ErrorDetails $ex = $exs[0] Write-Host \u0026#34;Response content:`n$ex\u0026#34; Write-Host \u0026#34;Request to $Uri failed with HTTP Status $($ex.Message)\u0026#34; Break } } This is the set of assignments on an existing Settings Catalog profile that we can now query.\nSettings Catalog assignments in Microsoft Intune. Passing through the Id we will get an output that looks like the below for the above assignments, with the target being the important part, as this contains the details of the types of assignments as well as the Ids of the groups the profile is assigned to.\nid : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5_b2358c32-aff8-4408-bf90-d6c4c4e73a90 source : direct sourceId : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5 target : @{@odata.type=#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget; deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId=; deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType=none; groupId=b2358c32-aff8-4408-bf90-d6c4c4e73a90} id : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5_c4480982-3342-4dc5-9c58-b272a77b7ab1 source : direct sourceId : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5 target : @{@odata.type=#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget; deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId=4feb8cf9-1529-41d6-80bb-498922c5e567; deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType=include; groupId=c4480982-3342-4dc5-9c58-b272a77b7ab1} id : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5_f9c1e630-771d-4c12-b366-8a3e4db0509a source : direct sourceId : 0565e69e-7bba-455a-bfaa-4ca6680a02b5 target : @{@odata.type=#microsoft.graph.exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget; deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId=; deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType=none; groupId=f9c1e630-771d-4c12-b366-8a3e4db0509a} So we kinda have the bits we need to get existing assignments, what about adding a new assignment?\nAssigning Settings Catalogs # First thing to note about assignments in Microsoft Intune, is there is no PATCH option with Graph API for the assignment endpoints, what this means is there is no native way to update the assignments of a Settings Catalog profile, the default behaviour is to replace any and all existing assignments. After trying to deal with the restrictions around assignments, I can understand why there is no PATCH option, as it\u0026rsquo;s a nightmare dealing with the logic.\nWe however, are not an API, so we can apply our squishy human brains and work something out to give us the ability to add new assignments, without ripping out the existing ones surely?\nBuilding New Assignments # So where do we start exactly? With the many different ways to assign a profile, or the twelfty different restrictions when adding new assignments to existing ones? Let\u0026rsquo;s go with the relatively simple creation of new assignments first, as this seems a little more straightforward.\nLuckily for us, Microsoft provide documentation for the JSON format of the payload required to create a new assignment, and as we have our own function to get existing assignments, we can quite easily build out the required data in PowerShell based on each of the methods for assignment.\nThe table below details the data used for each assignment method, so this is useful reference for us when building our own assignment function.\nTarget Type Name Value Group Include @odata.type #microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget groupId Id of the Assignment Group Group Exclude @odata.type #microsoft.graph.exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget groupId Id of the Assignment Group All Users Include @odata.type #microsoft.graph.allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget All Devices Include @odata.type #microsoft.graph.allDevicesAssignmentTarget Device Filter Include deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType Include deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId Id of the Device Filter Device Filter Exclude deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType Exclude deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId Id of the Device Filter So we can take the above and using the below excerpt from an existing assignment function, build the required JSON data.\n$TargetGroup = New-Object -TypeName psobject if ($GroupId) { if ($AssignmentType -eq \u0026#39;Exclude\u0026#39;) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget\u0026#39; } elseif ($AssignmentType -eq \u0026#39;Include\u0026#39;) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#39; } $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;groupId\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#34;$GroupId\u0026#34; } else { if ($All -eq \u0026#39;Users\u0026#39;) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget\u0026#39; } ElseIf ($All -eq \u0026#39;Devices\u0026#39;) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.allDevicesAssignmentTarget\u0026#39; } } if ($FilterType) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#39; -Value $FilterId $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#39; -Value $FilterType } $Target = New-Object -TypeName psobject $Target | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;target\u0026#39; -Value $TargetGroup This will give us the correct format that can be submitted to Graph API to create a new assignment for example for All Users with a Device Filter.\n{ \u0026#34;assignments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4feb8cf9-1529-41d6-80bb-498922c5e567\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;include\u0026#34; } } ] } Or including a Group with a Device Filter.\n{ \u0026#34;assignments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f9c1e630-771d-4c12-b366-8a3e4db0509a\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4feb8cf9-1529-41d6-80bb-498922c5e567\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;include\u0026#34; } } ] } That was the easy part, and we can take the above methods to create new assignments. So now onto the head scratcher.\nCapturing Existing Assignments # We have the Get-DeviceSettingsCatalogAssignment function at our disposal now, so we can query a Settings Catalog profile to get any existing assignments, which is going to be important when dealing with the logic of adding new ones, for now we just need to get the existing ones into a useable JSON format so we can punt it back to Graph API.\n#Gets existing Assignments $Assignments = Get-DeviceSettingsCatalogAssignment -Id $Id # Creates an array for the existing assignments $TargetGroups = @() foreach ($Assignment in $Assignments) { $TargetGroup = New-Object -TypeName psobject $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value $Assignment.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; if ($Assignment.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -like \u0026#39;*groupAssignmentTarget*\u0026#39;) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;groupId\u0026#39; -Value $Assignment.target.groupId } if ($Assignment.target.deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType -ne \u0026#39;none\u0026#39;) { $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#39; -Value $Assignment.target.deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#39; -Value $Assignment.target.deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType } $Target = New-Object -TypeName psobject $Target | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;target\u0026#39; -Value $TargetGroup $TargetGroups += $Target } This captures the existing assignments and adds them to the $TargetGroups array variable, which can then be added to for any new assignments we want to add, then converted to JSON and eventually posted to Graph API.\nSo for our example, the output of the above would look something like the below.\n{ \u0026#34;assignments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;b2358c32-aff8-4408-bf90-d6c4c4e73a90\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;c4480982-3342-4dc5-9c58-b272a77b7ab1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;4feb8cf9-1529-41d6-80bb-498922c5e567\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;include\u0026#34; } }, { \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.exclusionGroupAssignmentTarget\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;f9c1e630-771d-4c12-b366-8a3e4db0509a\u0026#34; } } ] } We\u0026rsquo;re onto something here, time to look at the logic around adding new assignments to existing ones, mmmm logic my favourite coffee fuelled exercise.\nHandling Existing Assignments # Now that we can capture existing assignment, we need to deal with the logic when trying to add new assignments to the Settings Catalog profile. This will not be fun.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go through each of the assignment non-nos we\u0026rsquo;ve already covered in this post.\nInclude Assignments # Assigning to All Devices and a Group of Devices or Users We just need to check if the function parameter $All which equates to an option to assign to All Device or All Users exists, and whether there are any existing group targetted assignment on the Settings Catalog profile.\nElseIf (($All -ne \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) -and ($Assignments.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -contains \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#39;)) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;The policy is already assigned to a group(s), and cannot be assigned to All Devices or All Users groups\u0026#39; break } Assigning to All Users and a Group of Devices or Users This one is covered by the above logic, as we wrote the If statement to only look for the $All parameter which takes into consideration both the All Devices and All Users assignment targets.\nAssigning to a Group that already has an assignment This one is pretty easy really, we just need to compare the GroupId of the new assignment, to any existing assignments targetting to groups, and if the Ids match, to stop the function from running.\nIf (($GroupId -ne \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) -and ($GroupId -in $Assignments.target.groupId)) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;The policy is already assigned to the Group\u0026#39; break } Assigning to All Devices that already has an assignment Similar to the above, we\u0026rsquo;re checking to see if the new All Devices assignment already existing, and if it does, stopping the progress of the assignment.\nIf (($All -eq \u0026#39;Devices\u0026#39;) -and ($Assignments.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -contains \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.allDevicesAssignmentTarget\u0026#39;)) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;The policy is already assigned to the All Devices group\u0026#39; break } Assigning to All Users that already has an assignment This was pretty much a copy and paste of the above, just swapping the devices parameters for the users one.\nIf (($All -eq \u0026#39;Users\u0026#39;) -and ($Assignments.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -contains \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget\u0026#39;)) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;The policy is already assigned to the All Users group\u0026#39; break } Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users if All Devices already has an assignment We need to identity whether a group assignment is being created, which is captured with the $GroupId function parameter, and whether either the All Devices or All Users assignment target exists, and if it does break the function from running.\nIf (($GroupId -ne \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) -and (($Assignments.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -contains \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.allDevicesAssignmentTarget\u0026#39;) -or ($Assignments.target.\u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -contains \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget\u0026#39;))) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;The policy is already assigned to All Devices or All Users groups, and cannot be assigned to a group\u0026#39; break } Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users if All Users already has an assignment This one is captured in the above logic, which is lucky as I was running out of steam by this point.\nExclude Assignments # Assigning to Groups of Devices or Users with any Device Filter Using the parameters of the function itself, we can stop this assignment type, with parameters configured for Group assignment in $GroupID and the Assignment Type parameter $AssignmentType, as well as the Filter ID parameter $FilterId. With this combination of parameters being true, we can throw an error and stop the function from running.\nIf (($AssignmentType -eq \u0026#39;Exclude\u0026#39;) -and ($GroupId -ne \u0026#39;\u0026#39;) -and ($FilterId -ne \u0026#39;\u0026#39;)) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;You cannot assign a group with a filter as an exclude assignment\u0026#39;

Now we have something to review, with two additional fields of ElevationType and Group that we will use for creation of new EPM policies and rules later on, forward planning here.\nEPM Policies # I have no shame when I say that I started from Andrew Taylor\u0026rsquo;s script to create EPM rules using PowerShell, allowing the creation of new EPM Policies and associated rules in Microsoft Intune based on a local files on the machine the script is being executed from. For me what this was missing was the ability to create multiple rules per EPM policy, and the to not rely on the file being local to the machine running the script to capture the required rule data.\nImporting Rule Data # With the CSV report exported, we now need to update the file itself, removing entries where we don\u0026rsquo;t want to create rules, and updating those we do want to create with both the ElevationType and Group for each rule we want to create. The ElevationType field needs to be populated with one of the below entries based on the approval type to be used:\nAutomatic: elevation happens invisibly to the user. There\u0026rsquo;s no prompt, and no indication that the file is running in an elevated context. UserAuthentication: A user confirmed elevation always requires the user to click on a confirmation prompt to run the file requiring users to authenticate using their organization credentials. UserJustification: A user confirmed elevation always requires the user to click on a confirmation prompt to run the file requiring the user to enter a business justification. The group field is there to not only reference which Azure Active Directory or synchronised Active Directory group the rule will apply to, but will allow for grouping of rules into a single policy, as this just makes sense as we\u0026rsquo;ll be applying the policy to the same group.\nGrouping EPM Rules # As we want to create a single policy for each provided group, containing all applicable rules, we need to capture the data based on the assignment group, this can be done pretty easily using the Group-Object command.\n$Policies = Import-Csv -Path $ImportPath | Group-Object -Property Group Now we can check if the supplied group exists, using the below function to search for the group based on it\u0026rsquo;s name.\nFunction Get-IntuneGroup() { [cmdletbinding()] param ( [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] [string]$Name ) $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#39;groups\u0026#39; try { $authToken[\u0026#39;ConsistencyLevel\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;eventual\u0026#39; $searchterm = \u0026#39;search=\u0026#34;displayName:\u0026#39; + $Name + \u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#39; $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$Resource`?$searchterm\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get).Value } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } Take note of the change to the $authtoken variable which needs updating to include \u0026lsquo;ConsistencyLevel\u0026rsquo; to support advanced queries using Graph API. We can ensure that the group exists prior to deploying the EPM policies to Microsoft Intune, and set the variables for each new rule to be created based on the data in the CSV file.\nforeach ($Policy in $Policies) { $Group = Get-IntuneGroup -Name $Policy.Name if ($null -eq $Group) { Write-Output \u0026#34;$($Policy.Name) group does not exist, unable to create EPM Policy\u0026#34; break } else { $Rules = $Policy.Group $JSONRules = @() foreach ($Rule in $Rules) { $FileName = $Rule.FileName $FileInternalName = $Rule.FileInternalName $FilePath = $Rule.FilePath $FileHash = $Rule.FileHash $ElevationType = $Rule.ElevationType $FileProduct = $Rule.Product -replace \u0026#39;[^\\x30-\\x39\\x41-\\x5A\\x61-\\x7A]+\u0026#39;, \u0026#39; \u0026#39; $FileDescription = $Rule.Description $RuleDescription = $($Rule.Publisher + \u0026#39; \u0026#39; + $Rule.Description) -replace \u0026#39;[^\\x30-\\x39\\x41-\\x5A\\x61-\\x7A]+\u0026#39;, \u0026#39; \u0026#39; Now onto the fun that is EPM policy and rule creation.\nCreating Settings Catalog Policies # The EPM Policies sit within the Setting Catalog space in Microsoft Intune, and it\u0026rsquo;s no secret that creating new Settings Catalog policies in Microsoft Intune is no walk in the park as per this post from Powers Hell.

Well clearly you jump at the chance and hope that it\u0026rsquo;s not a body part this time. So here we are, looking at how to deploy Microsoft Teams Backgrounds to macOS devices using Intune, for organisations without the licensing to allow for corporate branding using Microsoft Teams Premium Experience.\nTeams Meeting Backgrounds # So after a quick search, to add new backgrounds for Teams we need to dump files in ~/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds, this directory will exist under the logged in User context, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to need a way to both create an \u0026lsquo;Uploads\u0026rsquo; directory and dump the background files in there.\nChecking for the Teams App # Before we start throwing files in a directory, we should probably check to see if Teams is actually installed, luckily having spent many evenings peering over the macOS Shell Scripts hosted in Intune Shell Scripts, we can use the Dock Customisation script, as there\u0026rsquo;s a section in there that waits for the detection of apps before allowing the script to continue.\nSo we\u0026rsquo;ll pinch that section and update it so it\u0026rsquo;s only checking for the Microsoft Teams.app\nteamsapp=\u0026#34;/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app\u0026#34; while [[ $ready -ne 1 ]]; do missingappcount=0 if [[ -a \u0026#34;$teamsapp\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;$(date) | $teamsapp is installed\u0026#34; else let missingappcount=$missingappcount+1 fi echo \u0026#34;$(date) | [$missingappcount] application missing\u0026#34; if [[ $missingappcount -eq 0 ]]; then ready=1 echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Teams App found, lets prep the dock\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Waiting for 10 seconds\u0026#34; sleep 10 fi done This will sit and wait for Teams to be detected, so make sure you\u0026rsquo;ve either already deployed Teams to your devices and/or have a \u0026lsquo;Required\u0026rsquo; install intent for either Microsoft Teams or Microsoft Office, in Intune.\nGetting the Logged in User # Like the Dock Customisation script, we can run the script from Intune as the signed-in user, and as we\u0026rsquo;re dealing with data in the User context, this makes the most sense. We can capture the signed-in user using the built-in $HOME variable, and creating a new teamsUpload variable to use later.\nteamsUpload=\u0026#34;$HOME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads\u0026#34; Checking the Background Directory # Right, that was easier than I thought, we should look at how to check if the directory exists, and if not create it.\nif [[ -d ${teamsUpload} ]] then echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Teams Background Upload dir [$teamsUpload] already exists\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Creating [$teamsUpload]\u0026#34; mkdir -p \u0026#34;$teamsUpload\u0026#34; fi Now onto how we get files in the directory, without just copy and pasting.\nYou may have noticed by now that I\u0026rsquo;m not explaining in much depth how the Shell commands work, well that\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m still on a steep learning curve myself. Bear with me here, it ain\u0026rsquo;t PowerShell is it. Deploying Files with Shell Scripts # I already know there\u0026rsquo;s a working method to deploy a Desktop Background to a macOS device enrolled in Microsoft Intune. So we\u0026rsquo;ll do what any right minded Consultant would do, and steal modify the script to our needs.\nScript Variables # The original script used a single variable wallpaperurl to capture the desktop wallpaper URL, which is nice and all, and obviously fits the Desktop Background purpose, but we\u0026rsquo;d like to give our users options of Teams Backgrounds, so we\u0026rsquo;ll use an array to hold our list of URLs to the background files (see I am learning).\nbackgroundurls=(\u0026#34;https://memv.ennbee.uk/bgr.png\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://memv.ennbee.uk/wp-lt.png\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://memv.ennbee.uk/wp.png\u0026#34;) For any additional URLs, you can add a new line to the array.\nThis lack of a $ when configuring new variables is unsettling me if I\u0026rsquo;m honest, but we move. Downloading with Curl # Pretty simple really, even I can use curl to download the background files to the directory location -L, passing in the URL and a filename as part of the output -o option. We\u0026rsquo;ve added the `-s\u0026rsquo; so as to not clog the log file with the raw download data.\ncurl -s -L -o $teamsUpload/$backgroundfile $backgroundurl We now need to loop through each of the items in the backgroundurls array, and we also need to give each a filename for backgroundfile that isn\u0026rsquo;t duplicated, otherwise we\u0026rsquo;ll end up downloading and overwriting the same file for each URL in the array.\nIncremental Filenames # We can quickly create new file names as part of the for loop needed for the items in the array, by incrementing a variable, and appending that variable to the backgroundfile variable.\ni=0 for backgroundurl in \u0026#34;${backgroundurls[@]}\u0026#34;; do ((i=i+1)) backgroundfile=\u0026#34;TeamsBackground$i.png\u0026#34; ... done This will make sure that each downloaded background file gets a new filename, this won\u0026rsquo;t cater for multiple initiations of the script, but remember, I\u0026rsquo;m still new at this.\nTeams Background Script # The full script looks pretty much like the below, which is just a squishing together of the bits we\u0026rsquo;ve already covered in this post.\n#!/bin/bash #set -x ############################################################################################ ## ## Script to download Teams Backgrounds ## ########################################### # Define variables # Add new background URLs to the array backgroundurls=(\u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ennnbeee/mem-scripts/main/Intune/Scripts/Shell/TeamsBackgrounds/Msft_Nostalgia_Landscape.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ennnbeee/mem-scripts/main/Intune/Scripts/Shell/TeamsBackgrounds/SupportUkraine_Heart_TeamsBackground.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ennnbeee/mem-scripts/main/Intune/Scripts/Shell/TeamsBackgrounds/covermichael.jpg\u0026#34;) scriptname=\u0026#34;SetTeamsBackground\u0026#34; teamsapp=\u0026#34;/Applications/Microsoft Teams.app\u0026#34; logandmetadir=\u0026#34;$HOME/Library/Logs/Microsoft/Intune/Scripts/$scriptname\u0026#34; log=\u0026#34;$logandmetadir/$scriptname.log\u0026#34; teamsUpload=\u0026#34;$HOME/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/Teams/Backgrounds/Uploads\u0026#34; ## Check if the log directory has been created if [ -d $logandmetadir ]; then ## Already created echo \u0026#34;# $(date) | Log directory already exists - $logandmetadir\u0026#34; else ## Creating Metadirectory echo \u0026#34;# $(date) | creating log directory - $logandmetadir\u0026#34; mkdir -p \u0026#34;$logandmetadir\u0026#34; fi # start logging exec 1\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;$log\u0026#34; 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;##############################################################\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;# $(date) | Starting download of Teams Backgrounds\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;############################################################\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;\u0026#34; ## ## Checking if Teams is Installed ## while [[ $ready -ne 1 ]]; do missingappcount=0 if [[ -e \u0026#34;$teamsapp\u0026#34; ]]; then echo \u0026#34;$(date) | $teamsapp is installed\u0026#34; else let missingappcount=$missingappcount+1 fi echo \u0026#34;$(date) | [$missingappcount] application missing\u0026#34; if [[ $missingappcount -eq 0 ]]; then ready=1 echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Teams App found, lets download the backgrounds\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Waiting for 10 seconds\u0026#34; sleep 10 fi done ## ## Checking if Teams Backgrounds Upload directory exists and create it if it\u0026#39;s missing ## if [[ -d ${teamsUpload} ]]; then echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Teams Background Upload dir [$teamsUpload] already exists\u0026#34; else echo \u0026#34;$(date) | Creating [$teamsUpload]\u0026#34; mkdir -p \u0026#34;$teamsUpload\u0026#34; fi ## ## Attempt to download the files.

Summary # This was a pretty straight forward method to deploy backgrounds to Microsoft Teams using Intune Shell Scripts, and not a bad start to my journey into advanced management of macOS devices (despite actually being a macOS user). I\u0026rsquo;d recommend familiarising yourself with the Intune Shell Samples, as this is where started when hacking about with Shell scripts for macOS devices.\nOr you could just pay for Microsoft Teams Premium, but where\u0026rsquo;s the fun in that?\n","date":"14 March 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/macos-teams-backgrounds/","section":"Posts","summary":"What happens when a stranger on the Internet asks you to look at something they\u0026rsquo;ve got a problem with? Here we are, looking at how to deploy Microsoft Teams Backgrounds to macOS devices.","title":"Deploying Teams Backgrounds to macOS Devices","type":"posts"},{"content":"As both Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager are a match made in heaven, there are many reasons to still utilise both, either using Co-Management or just plain old Tenant Attach, so imagine my joy when Microsoft released Co-Management Authority in Intune, and I thought the days of packaging the Configuration Manager Client were over.\nNow imagine my face when I read the requirements and the fact it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support Autopilot Hybrid Join scenarios.\nI get it, installing the client during Autopilot will pretty much break the deployment, but there should be a way to install the client and not have it bend over and only accept Configuration Manager deployed workloads.\nPackaging the Configuration Manager Client has been covered, many, many, many, many times, almost to death in fact, so I\u0026rsquo;m not going to show you how to package the client files, what I am going to show you is a couple of tricks to make the installation easier, and not break Autopilot.\nApp Requirement Rules # To stop the application from running during the Autopilot process, we can add in a Requirement Rule to ensure that we\u0026rsquo;re not in the Out of Box Experience (OOBE). We\u0026rsquo;ve got a couple of options here, whether it\u0026rsquo;s detecting if the CloudExperienceHostBroker Service is running, or if the User account context is running under defaultUser0.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve gone with the Service approach, as it saves Intune having to run Get-ComputerInfo -Property CsUserName every time it wants to check if the requirement has been met.\nWith this, we can create a Requirement Rule Script using the below to check if the CloudExperienceHostBroker service is running, and if not returning Install:\n$ESPProcess = Get-Process -Name CloudExperienceHostBroker -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue if ($ESPProcess.Count -eq 0) { Return \u0026#39;Install\u0026#39; } Pretty straight forward for one of my documented scripts, but either way, save the file locally as something you can remember.\nCreate the rule in Intune with the below settings:\nItem Value Requirement Type Script Script Name Autopilot_Not_Running.ps1 Script content {{Script Content}} Run script as 32-bit process on 64-bit clients No Run this script using the logged on credentials No Enforce script signature check No Select Output data type String Operator Equals Value Install Giving us something like this:\nMicrosoft Intune application requirement rule. This will now stop the installation from even starting during Autopilot phase, and only start the installation once the requirement has been met.\nApp Detection Methods # Now that we can control when the Client is installed, we need a way to detect that it has installed, and to be honest, we don\u0026rsquo;t actually care if the Client itself has installed correctly, as the Client setup will just sit and try to install itself every ten minutes until it can.\nIf we had a detection rule for either the MSI product code, or a File check for the client itself, we\u0026rsquo;d be waiting for an absolute age for Intune to be happy and confirm the installation state. We do not want this.\nWhat we do want, is a quick and easy way to ensure that the setup files exist on the device, then we can let the ccmsetup.exe do it\u0026rsquo;s magical thing and install the Client and the associated service.\nSo for the detection rule, we\u0026rsquo;ll just look for the presence of the setup file:\nItem Value Rule Type File Path %windir%\\ccmsetup File or Folder ccmsetup.exe Detection Method File or Folder Exists Associated with a 32-bit app on 64-bit client No This looks a little bit like the below:\nMicrosoft Intune application detection method. Allowing for a quick and easy detection of the required setup files on the device.\nIntune Only Mode # If you\u0026rsquo;re wanting Intune to manage all the workloads on the device, and not rely on Co-Managed Workloads at all, there is a solution for this, and one taken straight from Microsoft and their implementation of the Co-Management Authority in Intune.\nYour endpoints enrolled in Intune today have a concept of management authority. That authority tells the device what service owns the management of the workloads on that device. The authority owner can be tracked by a simple registry key and value. This is the value that they\u0026rsquo;re on about:\nHKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DeviceManageabilityCSP\\Provider\\MS DM Server When provisioning a device with Autopilot, the above key gets created right after you enter your username and password on the enrolment screen. This key tells the device who the authority is for workload management* Here\u0026rsquo;s the legend for the key:\n1 – Intune 2 – Configuration Manager Right, so if we really wanted to stick with Intune as the management authority here, we can leverage the above information and force the device to stick with Intune for it\u0026rsquo;s management needs, and in the case of App deployment, the device will still receive Apps from both Intune and Configuration Manger if the key value is set to Intune.\nProactive Remediation # As I\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned previously if you\u0026rsquo;re licensed to use Proactive Remediation Scripts, you should be using them, and in anger. We can throw together a script that looks for the registry key HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DeviceManageabilityCSP\\Provider\\MS DM Server\\ConfigInfo, create it if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, and set it to 1 telling the device to only deal with Intune.\nDetection Script # As with all Proactive Remediation scripts, we need a method to detect, which is run initially upon assessment, and subsequently after remediation. A standard check, fix, check situation. For the detection method, we\u0026rsquo;re looking for both the Registry Key and the item.\nTry { $Registry = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DeviceManageabilityCSP\\Provider\\MS DM Server\u0026#39; $Path = Test-Path $Registry $Authority = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path $Registry -Name ConfigInfo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue if ($Path -eq $False) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;Co-Management Authority Not Confgured\u0026#39; Exit 1 } else { if ($Authority -ne \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;) { Write-Warning \u0026#39;Co-Management Authority set to Configuration Manager\u0026#39; Exit 1 } else { Write-Output \u0026#39;Co-Management Authority set to Intune\u0026#39; Exit 0 } } } Catch { Write-Error $_.Exception Exit 2000 } Remediation Script # If either the Key or the Data are not detected, we have a Remediation script that configures either the Key and the Data, or just the Data.\nTry { $Registry = \u0026#39;HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\DeviceManageabilityCSP\\Provider\\MS DM Server\u0026#39; $Path = Test-Path $Registry $Authority = Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path $Registry -Name ConfigInfo -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue if ($Path -eq $false) { New-Item -Path $Registry -Force | Out-Null New-ItemProperty -Path $Registry -Name ConfigInfo -Value 1 -PropertyType String -Force } else { if ($Authority -ne \u0026#39;1\u0026#39;) { New-ItemProperty -Path $Registry -Name ConfigInfo -Value 1 -PropertyType String -Force } } } Catch { Write-Error $_.Exception Exit 2000 } Creating a Custom Script # With the above PowerShell scripts saved, we can now create our own Proactive Remediation Script and deploy this to the devices we only want to be managed by Intune, in this case, the Hybrid Joined Autopilot devices:\nMicrosoft Intune remediation script. Make sure you\u0026rsquo;re using 64-bit PowerShell for this script, as we don\u0026rsquo;t want anything screwy going on with the registry settings.\nSummary # We\u0026rsquo;ve managed to delay the installation of the Configuration Manager Client, as well as ensure it\u0026rsquo;s detected quickly once installed, and once it does install and the Client starts looking at Configuration Manager for it\u0026rsquo;s Co-Management settings, we\u0026rsquo;ve even got a way to tell Configuration Manager to look the other way and not break Autopilot whilst letting Intune do its thing.\nAll in all, although not a Microsoft supported method for deploying the Client, it is one that works.

Mobile App Assignment # First off, before we even start looking at how we bring this all together, is to understand how we can assign an App using Graph. So as we\u0026rsquo;ve done before, we could look under the hood and check the Browser Developer Tools to see what is actually going on, or we can just check the Graph documentation.\nWith this we now know that to use the POST /deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/{mobileAppId}/assign call, we\u0026rsquo;ll need the {mobileAppId}, we\u0026rsquo;re in luck, as we\u0026rsquo;ve already got a function Get-MobileApps to do this for us.\nAssignment Types # Knowing the call to Graph is the easy bit, building the JSON data we\u0026rsquo;re sending to it using the POST request is a different story, but at least we\u0026rsquo;ve got a framework to start us off, thanks Microsoft.\n{ \u0026#34;mobileAppAssignments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.mobileAppAssignment\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;591620b7-20b7-5916-b720-1659b7201659\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;intent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;required\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;microsoft.graph.deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentTarget\u0026#34; }, \u0026#34;settings\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;microsoft.graph.mobileAppAssignmentSettings\u0026#34; } } ] } We\u0026rsquo;ve built JSON data in PowerShell before, so this one isn\u0026rsquo;t any different, we do however need to cater for Installation Intents, Assignment Groups, Device Filters, and Device Filter States. These can be broken down as below, with the ones we actually care about in bold.\nItem Details Installation Intents Required, Available for Enrolled Devices, Available for Un-enrolled Devices, Uninstall Assignment Groups All Users, All Devices, Groups Filters States Include, Exclude We need to allow for the ability to assign Mobile Apps to all permutations of the above, whether this is a Required installation to All Devices, including a Device Filter, or an Available installation to a Group of Users. You get the picture.\nApp Assignment JSON # We can now start to build the JSON data we can POST to Graph, but we do need a bit more information when it comes to the content of the JSON data, in particular what is acceptable in the microsoft.graph.deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentTarget as well as how we pass through a Device Filter as part of the assignment, what headings are needed depending on the Assignment Target as well as the Install Intent.\nThe below structure details the setup for the JSON:\nmobileAppAssignments odata.type #microsoft.graph.mobileAppAssignment: This will be the same for each request intent required: Requiring the App to be installed available: Making the App available to be installed uninstall: Uninstalling the App target odata.type #microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget: Assigns the App the a Group groupId: If using the group assignment, the Id of the Group #microsoft.graph.allLicensedUsersAssignmentTarget: Assigns the App the inbuilt All Users Group #microsoft.graph.allDevicesAssignmentTarget: Assigns the App the inbuilt All Devices Group deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId id: Device Filter Id deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType include: Includes the devices in the filter exclude: Excludes the devices in the filter We need to build separate objects in PowerShell to complete the JSON hierarchy, and we can happily do this using PowerShell using something like the below:\nBuilding the PSObject for odata.type and intent, with the App to be an Available Installation Intent:\n$Target = New-Object -TypeName PSObject $Target | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.mobileAppAssignment\u0026#39; $Target | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;intent\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;available If we\u0026rsquo;re going for a Group based assignment including a Device Filter, we can build this and add to the existing $Target object using:\n$TargetGroup = New-Object -TypeName PSObject $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;@odata.type\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#39; $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;groupId\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;{Group.Id}\u0026#39; $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;{FilterId}\u0026#39; $TargetGroup | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#39; -Value \u0026#39;include\u0026#39; $Target | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;target\u0026#39; -Value $TargetGroup Then the final PSObject for mobileAppAssignments, adding everything together, and converting it to JSON:\n$Output = New-Object -TypeName PSObject $Output | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name \u0026#39;mobileAppAssignments\u0026#39; -Value @($Target) $JSON = $Output | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 3 Giving us the below output:\n{ \u0026#34;mobileAppAssignments\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.mobileAppAssignment\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;intent\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;available\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;target\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@odata.type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;#microsoft.graph.groupAssignmentTarget\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;groupId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{Group.Id}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;{FilterId}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;deviceAndAppManagementAssignmentFilterType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;include\u0026#34; } } ] } This looks miraculously like the Microsoft example, but you know, same same but different. If it actually had the correct {FilterId} and {GroupId} in place, it would allow us to assign an App when pushed to Graph.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re getting there, bear with me, I thought this post would be shorter.\nFunction Building Blocks # There are a few components we need to put together in the form of functions to enable the assignment of Mobile Apps, if we\u0026rsquo;re being complete about this, and for once we are (ish), we need to consider the following:\nGetting Mobile Apps Getting Device Filters Getting Groups Getting existing Assignments Dealing with existing Assignments All of the above will alter the way we deal with the JSON data we are creating, so one for future me to deal with. For now, on to the functions.\nRemember we\u0026rsquo;ll need to authenticate to Graph using Connect-MgGraph for all of these.\nGetting Mobile Apps # This one has come straight from an existing script, but we\u0026rsquo;ll need to filter the data gathered, otherwise we\u0026rsquo;re dragging back every Mobile App, including those referenced in App Protection Policies, and we don\u0026rsquo;t want to do anything with those today.\nFunction Get-MobileApps() { [cmdletbinding()] $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;Beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#39;deviceAppManagement/mobileApps\u0026#39; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get).Value } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } Getting Device Filters # To fix our missing {FilterId} issue, we need to be able to capture this data. This is a quick one, as we just need a call to GET deviceManagement/assignmentFilters resource, once we\u0026rsquo;ve authenticated to Graph of course.\nFunction Get-DeviceFilter() { $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#39;deviceManagement/assignmentFilters\u0026#39; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get).Value } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } This function will pull back all Device Filters in the Intune tenant, so we might need to filter this down later on.\nGetting Groups # Ah yes, Groups, I\u0026rsquo;d almost forgotten about these, but Dynamic Groups still have a place in Intune, and we need the {GroupId} to make this work, so we should find a way to grab these as well. As with the Device Filters, this is a call to Graph, but using the GET groups resource to capture the group id we need.\nIt was supposed to be so easy, however as we need to limit the number of Groups being pulled back, we need a way to search for a Group name. Here comes the Search Query Parameter, and importantly the need for ConsistencyLevel in the headers in the connection Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Headers @{ConsistencyLevel = 'eventual' }.\nName Value ---- ----- Content-Type application/json ConsistencyLevel eventual ExpiresOn 09/02/2023 11:49:47 +00:00 Authorization Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJub25jZSI6ImFVUTNp...

I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see a PATCH option for assignments, so we are going to have to write something ourselves to sort this at some point.\nHere is the function we can use to pull back the existing assignment data, I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t remember why I\u0026rsquo;ve done it this way, I think it was due to the lovely format in which the assignments were displayed, but here we only need an App $Id to make this one work.\nFunction Get-ApplicationAssignment() { [cmdletbinding()] param ( [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $Id ) $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;Beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#34;deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/$Id/?`$expand=categories,assignments\u0026#34; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Get) } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } Removing Existing Assignments # Even if we\u0026rsquo;re not accidentally removing existing assignments, we should give ourselves the option to undo any mistakes that we make when assigning Mobile Apps, so a quick tour of Graph gives us the DELETE mobileAppAssignment resource, and with a couple of parameters needed for both the App $Id and the Assignment $AssignmentId, we\u0026rsquo;ve got ourselves a function to get us out of trouble if we need it.\nFunction Remove-ApplicationAssignment() { [cmdletbinding()] param ( [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $Id, [parameter(Mandatory = $true)] $AssignmentId ) $graphApiVersion = \u0026#39;Beta\u0026#39; $Resource = \u0026#34;deviceAppManagement/mobileApps/$Id/assignments/$AssignmentId\u0026#34; try { $uri = \u0026#34;https://graph.microsoft.com/$graphApiVersion/$($Resource)\u0026#34; (Invoke-MgGraphRequest -Uri $uri -Method Delete) } catch { Write-Error $Error[0].ErrorDetails.Message break } } App Assignment Function # Finally we have all the parts to build the function, using the parameters below we can pass through the information needed to build the JSON data, pass through options as to whether we\u0026rsquo;re adding or replacing the assignment, and using some level of logic make sure we\u0026rsquo;re not messing this data up along the way.\nParameters # I\u0026rsquo;ve niced myself here and given options for the application of the function, covering all our requirements for assignment.

The script however does give you an easy way to bulk assign Mobile Apps in Intune, fully strip out assignments, or even just make every Mobile App available to everyone all at once, without too much clicking about.\nThere is definitely room for improvement and expansion, and at some point I\u0026rsquo;ll extend this to cover the assignment of Windows and macOS Apps; but for now you\u0026rsquo;ll have to make do with Android and iOS.\nAs always, please test this one before going large and selecting all your Mobile Apps, I\u0026rsquo;ve included warning break points for a reason.\n","date":"13 February 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/assigning-intune-applications/","section":"Posts","summary":"No one, and I mean no one, really wants to manually and individually assign Mobile Apps to Users or Devices in Intune in their 100\u0026rsquo;s, so we should find a solution for this bulk assignment approach.","title":"Assigning Intune Mobile Apps Quickly and Consistently","type":"posts"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m not going to go over old ground in too much detail, as I\u0026rsquo;ve already covered the importance of keeping your Operating System Compliance Policies up to date in line with the release of new updates, as well as a way to update your compliance policies using Graph and PowerShell.\nWhat I am going to do is extend this automated Compliance Policy update functionality to Apple Updates as well, it\u0026rsquo;s like I\u0026rsquo;ve been working with a customer that only has iOS/iPadOS devices in Intune or something.\nI guess when I end up working with a customer with only Android devices, that I\u0026rsquo;ll finally be able to put all the pieces together and have one script to update them all.\nOperating System Build Versions # Unlike the Windows Valid Operating System Builds option in Compliance Policies, Apple policies don\u0026rsquo;t give you the option of having a set of versions to work with, limited to only the following settings:\nMinimum OS version Maximum OS version Minimum OS build version Maximum OS build version With Apple having different build versions per Operating System, whether this is iOS/iPadOS or macOS, we\u0026rsquo;re unable to have one Compliance Policy that covers all the supported OS versions, and need to have specific policies per supported Operating System.\nDevice Filters # Now we all know where I stand on Device Filters and they come to the rescue once again, as we need separate Compliance Policies and the ability to target these to the correct devices.\nWe can create filters for each of the current supported (at time of writing) iOS/iPadOS and macOS operating systems:\nDescription OS Filter Rule All Corporate iOS 15 devices iOS (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Corporate\u0026quot;) and (device.osVersion -startsWith \u0026quot;15\u0026quot;) All Corporate iOS 16 devices iOS (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Corporate\u0026quot;) and (device.osVersion -startsWith \u0026quot;16\u0026quot;) All Corporate Big Sur devices macOS (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Corporate\u0026quot;) and (device.osVersion -startsWith \u0026quot;11\u0026quot;) All Corporate Monterey devices macOS (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Corporate\u0026quot;) and (device.osVersion -startsWith \u0026quot;12\u0026quot;) All Corporate Ventura devices macOS (device.deviceOwnership -eq \u0026quot;Corporate\u0026quot;) and (device.osVersion -startsWith \u0026quot;13\u0026quot;) Using these we can now create a Compliance Policy for each Operating System version, assigning it to the All Devices or All Users groups and include the corresponding Device Filter.\nCompliance Policies # You\u0026rsquo;ve probably created Compliance Policies before, and if you haven\u0026rsquo;t there are only a few clicks needed to configure one in preparation for the Operating System compliance check.\nAs the Apple build versions are unique, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to add in the settings Minimum OS version and Maximum OS version, though they are both a useful visual aide, and I could do with referencing them when I come to write a script to update the Compliance Policy.\nSo go ahead and create your Compliance Policies for each supported Operating System version, assigning them to the required group and filter:\nOS Version Minimum OS version iOS iOS 15 15.0.0 iOS iOS 16 16.0.0 macOS Big Sur 11.0.0 macOS Monterey 12.0.0 macOS Ventura 13.0.0 With both the Compliance Policies and the Device Filters in place, now we can move onto how we update the Build Versions.\nUpdates and RSS Feeds # As with the Windows Updates, Apple make their updates available in an easy to digest RSS feed which should make scraping back the information we need pretty straight forward:\n\u0026lt;item\u0026gt;

Overall this looks pretty good to me.\nSummary # We\u0026rsquo;re almost there with maintaining Operating System Compliance Policies, with Windows, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS under our belt, our next challenge will be Android, and bringing them all together into one single script.\nFor now though, we\u0026rsquo;ve reduced the overhead of having to manually update these Compliance Policies for three out of six four (let\u0026rsquo;s not mention Linux or ChromeOS just yet) Operating Systems supported in Microsoft Intune, so something to be happy about I guess.\n","date":"2 February 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/apple-os-updating-compliance/","section":"Posts","summary":"Apple devices shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be exempt from Operating System compliance policies, and these policies should share the same fate as Windows ones, and be updated monthly in line with update release cycles.","title":"Updating Apple Operating System Compliance Policies","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 January 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/automated-device-enrolment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Automated Device Enrolment","type":"tags"},{"content":"Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve made the financial sensible decision to migrate to Microsoft Intune for your Apple device management needs, you\u0026rsquo;ve got your Apple Push Certificate, sorted your Enrolment Token, added Intune as an MDM provider, and now you\u0026rsquo;ve got all your iOS/iPadOS devices happily sitting synchronised in Intune waiting to be deployed using Apple\u0026rsquo;s Automated Device Enrolment. Life is good.\nUntil you realise that in your excitement you\u0026rsquo;ve created loads of Enrolment Profiles (up to 1000 in fact, help), and you now have the daunting task of assigning your thousands (up to 200,000, fml) iOS/iPadOS devices to these profiles.\nNo one likes clicking that much.\nDeveloper Tool Sneaking # If you hadn\u0026rsquo;t realised already, everything in Microsoft Intune is backed by the Graph API, to the point where if you open your browser developer tools, usually by pressing F12, you can actually see the calls to Graph being made when you click around.\nEdge Developer Tools and Microsoft Intune.

Not ideal when deploying device remotely.\nCertificate Template # We can update the certificate deployment template in Intune to take into consideration the new name of the device, especially as we\u0026rsquo;re using an attribute as part of the device rename that Intune knows about, the serial number.\nAs the Simple Certificate Enrolment Protocol (SCEP) profile supports various device or user attributes we can add these into either Subject Name or Subject Alternative Name of the issued certificate, as well as any prefix we want to add such as L-:\nCN=L-{{SerialNumber}} DNS={{FullyQualifiedDomainName}} DNS={{DeviceName}} DNS=L-{{SerialNumber}}.ennbee.local This sorts out our certificate issue, as the device will have one that has all possible device names, the initial one assigned by the Domain Join profile, and the new one after the device has been renamed. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve our Domain trust issue though.\nProactive Remediation # We could do with a way to both check that the device name matches our expected naming convention of L-%SERIAL% for laptops, and D-%SERIAL% for desktops, and fixes the issue for us.\nThis is where Proactive Remediation scripts come to save us, and as I got M365 licenses for Christmas we can make use of them due to this being a licensing requirement.\nNow that we have new tools at our disposal, and modify permissions for \u0026lsquo;SELF\u0026rsquo; already in place in the destination Organisational Unit allowing the computer object to rename itself, we can hack about with the old script that was doing the computer rename as part of the Autopilot process, and using Proactive Remediation scripts, we can check that the existing device name matches the expected device name.\nDetection Script # First off we need a something to check that the device is Domain Joined (Lines 1-6), what the new Computer name is expected to be based on whether a desktop or laptop (Lines 8-21), and what the existing Computer name is (Lines 23-26).

Done. Post over.\nWhat if you want to ensure that all these accounts, and any future accounts used for MTR get this allowance for enrolment?\nDevice Enrolment # First off is creating an Enrolment Restriction profile that allows for Android Device Administrator enrolment, secondly is how we let Intune know that the devices are corporate owned, as they will be picked up as personal devices due to the enrolment method, and finally a way to capture all the MTR resource accounts together.\nEnrolment Restrictions # We can create a new Enrolment Restriction to allow for a group of users to enrol Android devices using the Device Administrator enrolment method, and we should block personal devices as well:\nAndroid enrolment restrictions in Microsoft Intune. With the restriction now created, we need to make sure that this restriction has a higher priority than any other enrolment restriction applying to either All Users or any other group that may contains the MTR resource accounts:\nAndroid enrolment restriction priority in Microsoft Intune. Perfect.\nCorporate Device Identifiers # With the Android Device Administrator enrolment being user driven, and not a method for device enrolment that will automatically set the device as corporate owned, if we attempted to enrol these MTR devices into Intune now, we\u0026rsquo;d get an error about the platform not being supported due to us blocking personal devices in the restriction we created.\nAndroid blocked enrolment. Corporate Device Identifiers to the rescue, kind of, basically this allows us to upload a unique identifier of a device so that when a device goes through an enrolment process, Intune knows it\u0026rsquo;s a corporate owned device.\nSo if the devices are running Android 10 and above, we\u0026rsquo;re straight out of luck and need to amend our restriction profile to allow personally owned device enrolment.\nHowever, if the device has below Android 10, we can add either the device IMEI number (don\u0026rsquo;t use this) or Serial number (do use this) in Intune to identify the device as corporate.\nUtilising Dynamic Groups # With the Device Platform Enrolment restriction in place, we could do with a group to assign this restriction to, if we\u0026rsquo;re strict with our naming conventions of these resource accounts being used for the MTR, such as prefixing all account with \u0026lsquo;MTR-\u0026rsquo;, we could go with something simple and use (user.userPrincipalName -startsWith \u0026quot;MTR-\u0026quot;) as part of our rule syntax.\nSadly though, I don\u0026rsquo;t like nor trust human input when it comes to device management and Intune, so we need to find a different way that at least reduces the human error part, if not removes it entirely and ensure that all new MTR accounts are added to the restriction.\nAssigned Licenses # This is where we use some of the more advanced features of Dynamic User groups, in the multi-value properties and in particular the use of licenses assigned to users. For this, we need to understand which licenses the MTR resource accounts have assigned, and find the correlating Service Plan Id for each service contained within the licenses.\nThe below table details the common services for both the \u0026lsquo;Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Microsoft Teams Rooms Pro without Audio Conferencing\u0026rsquo; licenses that allows for enrolment into Intune, the Services, and the Service Plan Ids:\nFriendly Name Service Name Service Plan Id Azure Active Directory Premium P1 AAD_PREMIUM 41781fb2-bc02-4b7c-bd55-b576c07bb09d Microsoft 365 Phone System MCOEV 4828c8ec-dc2e-4779-b502-87ac9ce28ab7 Microsoft Intune INTUNE_A c1ec4a95-1f05-45b3-a911-aa3fa01094f5 Microsoft Teams TEAMS1 57ff2da0-773e-42df-b2af-ffb7a2317929 Skype for Business Online (Plan 2) MCOSTANDARD 0feaeb32-d00e-4d66-bd5a-43b5b83db82c Whiteboard (Plan 3) WHITEBOARD_PLAN3 4a51bca5-1eff-43f5-878c-177680f191af So with this we can attempt to construct a Dynamic User group based on these services that are assigned and enabled for the MTR accounts.\nSome Dirty Logic # So as it turns out, the above services are part of a hundred other license options, so we need a way to drill down and find only the MTR accounts with these licenses or services assigned.\nI thought long and hard (about 5 minutes tbh) and came up with the below; basically making sure the above assigned licenses exist, but the user account doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any Exchange Online or SharePoint Online license assigned and enabled, hopefully filtering out any other users or user types from the group.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re actually using the Service Name captured from the Get-AzureADUser -User 'MTR-Room1@ennbee.uk' | Select -ExpandProperty AssignedPlans PowerShell command here, to cover off all plan types under the service, as there are so many Exchange Online plan types and I want to make this as clean as possible without having to list all the Exchange Online or SharePoint Online service plan Ids.\nSo here\u0026rsquo;s the logic we\u0026rsquo;re using to find only the MTR accounts using a Dynamic Group.\nLogic Rule User is assigned a Microsoft 365 Phone System license and is enabled (user.assignedPlans -any (assignedPlan.servicePlanId -eq \u0026quot;4828c8ec-dc2e-4779-b502-87ac9ce28ab7\u0026quot;

How much do you like PowerShell, Win32 Apps and passwords in plain text?\nWell you\u0026rsquo;re in luck, I\u0026rsquo;ve thrown together something that can help you out based on a need to ensure that Secure Boot is configured for Dell laptops when it was discovered via the Windows health attestation report that around 80% of the Windows devices had it turned off.\n(Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, I checked that the devices had GPT partitions before I just launched a PowerShell script at them.)\nDell PowerShell Provider # There are several posts kicking around the internet about using Microsoft Intune to not only change or set Dell BIOS passwords, but also using CSV files to configure BIOS settings using the Dell Command | PowerShell Provider, the below are the ones I\u0026rsquo;ve found and borrowed from:\nsystanddeploy.com ccmexec.com configjon.com These posts detail ways to use the Dell PowerShell Provider to set the BIOS configurations and an Admin BIOS Password on Dell devices, so I\u0026rsquo;m only going to focus on how I\u0026rsquo;ve taken this, run with it, and made it a little easier to handle in Microsoft Intune.\nSetting up the Module # As we\u0026rsquo;re going to be packaging up the PowerShell script as a Win32App, we\u0026rsquo;ll need to ensure that not only is the script available, but also the PowerShell module (and some rogue .dll files too for some reason).\nFrom an elevated PowerShell window run the below command to save the PowerShell module to a new folder:\nSave-Module -Name DellBIOSProvider -Path C:\\Temp\\Set-DellBIOS\\ The version at the time of writing of this module is 2.6.0, which has a reliance on some of the .dll files installed from the Visual C++ Re-distributables:\nDetails of the Dell requirements for their PowerShell module.

However, are you using Compliance Policies in the correct way, or even a way that makes sense?\nCompliance Granularity # I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about granularity of compliance settings, and the main reason to split out these Compliance settings into separate policies, is the actions for non-compliance; you see, you only get one set of these per policy.\nSo where you would want to mark a device as non-compliant immediately if there is no Antivirus installed, would you want it to be the same for the supported operating system builds? (Clue here, the answer is no).\nThis is a very real-world configuration, if you\u0026rsquo;re controlling the deferral and deadline settings of Software Updates via Windows Update for Business, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be fair and honourable for you to mark a device as non-compliant, and potentially block access to Office 365 authenticated services, when the computer itself hasn\u0026rsquo;t even received the update to be installed.\nOperating System Compliance # So now we know we should be using separate policies per compliance setting, so let\u0026rsquo;s look at Operating System Versions:\nMinimum and maximum operating system compliance policy settings in Microsoft Intune. With this setting you can configure the minimum and maximum operating system version, including build version using the below information to denote the format.\nThe operating system version is defined as major.minor.build.revision Sounds great, if and only if all of your Windows 10 devices are all running the same Feature Update.\nThe Problem # Let\u0026rsquo;s say your estate has the following supported (at time of writing) Windows 10 and later versions:\nWindows 10 20H2 Windows 10 21H1 Windows 10 21H2 Windows 11 21H2 So to cover all of the supported operating systems your minimum operating system compliance setting is going to be 10.0.19042.1766 (June 2022). Great.\nThis however means that any of the newer builds, patched or unpatched, will also be marked as compliant, as you know 10.0.19044.1111 is a bigger number than 10.0.19042.1766. Quick Maths.\nThis is a problem, as do you really want to mark unpatched operating systems as compliant. Again, answer here is no.\nThe Solution # This is where the \u0026lsquo;Valid operating system builds\u0026rsquo; section in the Compliance Policy comes into play, allowing you to split out each build in your End-user computing estate and each to have their own range of minimum and maximum:\nValid operating system builds in a compliance policy settings in Microsoft Intune. So there we have it, a fast turnaround for a real-world problem. Now about updating this monthly\u0026hellip;\nUpdating Compliance # When you update a Compliance Policy, it will trigger the devices the policy is assigned to, to re-evaluate the conditions and follow the actions for non-compliance if necessary. So you should be updating the Operating System Compliance Policy every month, which, although it isn\u0026rsquo;t a painful task, it is a repeatable one.\nNeedless Automation to the Rescue # So what does any good Consultant do in this situation? They write some PowerShell to do the work for them, even if writing the PowerShell script probably took longer than just updating the Compliance Policy.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve already demonstrated my coffee fuelled scripting in previous posts and this one isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be much different.\nFunctions are your Friends # We\u0026rsquo;ll need a few functions for this, some grabbed from the Intune PowerShell Samples GitHub repo, and some thrown together based on the samples.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll be authenticating to Graph, grabbing the Windows Compliance Policies that have the Valid Operating System Build setting, getting the latest OS Build version from the Microsoft Atom Feeds and then updating the Compliance Policy.

I\u0026rsquo;d call this one a win.\nSummary # There might be easier ways of doing this, or a little less caffeine fuelled at least, but if you want to bulk set Group Tags to your existing Autopilot devices, this does seem like a half decent approach.\nFor new devices, I recommend that you work with your supplier/OEM and get them to tag them as part of the on-boarding.\nAlso, you can run this many times, so if you do want to re-tag devices, you can use the CSV method to do so.\nAlso also, you should look at this post about using dynamic groups to ring fence your newly tagged devices.\n","date":"19 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/windows-autopilot-retrofitting-group-tags/","section":"Posts","summary":"Now that we know how powerful Autopilot Group Tags can be, we should look into how we can retrofit devices with these Group Tags when the OEM or Supplier didn\u0026rsquo;t bother doing their part of the deal.","title":"Retrofitting Windows Autopilot Group Tags","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"8 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/device-filters/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Device Filters","type":"tags"},{"content":"Now if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.\nWhat if I told you, that there\u0026rsquo;s something on par with these holy grail groups, and maybe, just maybe, even better.\nMy Beloved Dynamic Groups # Before we jump into Device Filters, let us talk about Dynamic Groups a little\u0026hellip;\nFirstly, I would highly recommend the use of these groups, especially for grouping devices, whether this be based on enrolment type, ownership, operating system type or version\u0026hellip;and if you\u0026rsquo;ve got something or someone managing your user attributes, that you use them for user groups.\nThe Limitations # This sadly, is how quickly these groups update; Microsoft probably realised that people were using these groups in relation to device management, and also realised that the enumeration of the groups was using precious Compute infrastructure, for free, smh.\nSo Microsoft reduced how often these groups fully updated to once every 24 hours.\nNow this is no good when we want to target settings and restrictions, or even just application deployment to these dynamically populated groups, we end up with delaying installations, configuration settings or even connectivity. Not a fan.\nBring on the Filters # So where Microsoft take away with one hand, they give with the other, and this is the new world of Device Filters.\nAt a high level, what makes filters so much better for use in Microsoft Intune comes down a couple of things:\nThe filter evaluation is done when the device enrols and/or checks in with the Intune service; this means the speed of evaluation is significantly faster than dynamic groups. Filters are entirely reusable meaning we can now create one filter and use it for many areas within Microsoft Intune. Device Filter evaluation workflow. Before a policy is applied to a device, filters dynamically evaluate applicability:\nYou create a filter for any platform based on some device properties.\nYou assign a policy or app to the group. In the assignment, you add the filter in either include or exclude mode. For example, you \u0026ldquo;include\u0026rdquo; personal devices, or you \u0026ldquo;exclude\u0026rdquo; personal devices from the policy.\nThe filter is evaluated when the device enrols or at any other time a policy evaluates.\nYou see the filter results based on the evaluation. For example, the app or policies applies, or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t apply.\nInconsistent Assignments # So we\u0026rsquo;ve talked about the limitations with Dynamic Groups, but we do need to talk about the limitations with Device Filters\u0026hellip; Not all areas of Microsoft Intune support the use of Filters (as of today, though this will hopefully change), meaning that you can\u0026rsquo;t provide a consistent application method of assignments.\nFor example, Autopilot profiles don\u0026rsquo;t support filters, and nor do Endpoint Security Profiles, nor PowerShell scripts, nor MAM policies:\nMissing Filter assignment options in Microsoft Intune. However, a lot of crucial areas do, including Compliance, Configuration and Windows Update for Business profiles:\nFilter assignment options in Microsoft Intune. Groups looking good here.\nFewer Properties # Device Filters have fewer attribute properties to work with compared with Dynamic Groups, so any advanced filtering like with Autopilot Group Tags will still need to be done using Dynamic Groups.\nDevice Filters Device Filter properties in Microsoft Intune. Dynamic Groups Dynamic Security Group properties in Microsoft Entra ID. Win for the Groups.\nFewer Operators # Device Filters do not support advanced logic with the operators such as \u0026lsquo;Match\u0026rsquo;, so turbo advanced filtering such as in Intelligent Phased Windows Update for Business Deployments need to be handled with groups still.\nDevice Filters Device Filter operators in Microsoft Intune. Dynamic Groups Dynamic Security Group operators in Microsoft Entra ID. Another win there, 3-0 to the Groups.\nSummary # Even with these Device Filter limitations (and the 3-0 loss), the benefits of reusability and speed in which they are processed still shine through over Dynamic Groups in many areas of Microsoft Intune, and I strongly recommend moving to using the \u0026lsquo;All Devices\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;All Users\u0026rsquo; in-built assignments in conjunction with Device Filters, just to make your life that little bit easier when managing devices.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve come this far, so why not give creating them a shot and create a filter or two?\n","date":"8 June 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/endpoint-manager-device-filters/","section":"Posts","summary":"Now if you\u0026rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.","title":"Dynamic Groups vs Device Filters","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"21 May 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/accessibility/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Accessibility","type":"tags"},{"content":"Have you ever wondered how to ensure that a number of languages are available for selection to end users on shared Windows 10 devices?

Good.\nSo what if you have multiple deployment profiles, or different device use cases with the same profile, or different user personas, or test and pilot deployments, or a range of applications, configurations or scripts that you want to separate out to the devices or users of the devices? You probably do\u0026hellip;what\u0026rsquo;s that you say, you\u0026rsquo;re using static groups to manage these? Let me show you the way forward.\nConfiguration # If you\u0026rsquo;ve got this far, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably know that Windows Autopilot is the modern deployment method for Windows 10/11 devices, allowing an organisation to pre-register corporate-owned devices (using their unique hardware hashes) and link these devices to the Azure AD tenant. Once the device is attached to the tenant, it is considered a trusted device that can be enrolled using Autopilot.\nBelow is an overview of the Windows Autopilot process, the bit we\u0026rsquo;re talking about is the Hardware Vendor adding the Device IDs; this is where the Vendor can also add Group Tags.\nAutopilot Group Tag Assignment process. Group Tags # A hidden gem with Autopilot service, is the Group Tag attribute for Autopilot devices, this tag can be provided during the pre-registration by a supplier or OEM, and can be configured or updated after the device has been imported.\nThis attribute is attached the computer object that exists in Azure AD, sadly not labelled as \u0026ldquo;Group Tag\u0026rdquo;, but as \u0026ldquo;OrderID\u0026rdquo; (this will be important later). As this attribute exists, we can utilise it with Dynamic Device groups\u0026hellip;do you see where this is going?\nNaming Conventions # Now he have this little beaut of a trick, we can start to look at how we use the Group Tag attribute to our advantage, and address some of the potential use cases for grouping Autopilot devices, whether this be based on deployment type, application assignment or just for overall better management of devices.\nI\u0026rsquo;m a big fan of having things named in a readable way, it just makes life a bit more straight forward in Microsoft Intune, and Group Tags are no different.\nSyntax # Your convention may differ from the below, as it will be entirely based on your own requirements, however I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a syntax starter for ten so you have an understanding of your options.\nPosition Value Description 1-2 AJ / HJ The Azure AD Join type - Azure AD or Hybrid Joined 3-4 LT / DT / VM The Device Type - Laptop, Desktop or Virtual Machine 5 U / S / K The Device Use Case - User Assigned, Shared or Kiosk 6-8 STD / ADM The User Type - Standard or Admin 9-11 FIN / HR / PAY The Users Department - Finance, HR or, Payroll etc. 12-13 UK / US / FR The Device Location - United Kingdom, United States, France etc. With this basic syntax in place, we can build out the Group Tag for devices:\nGroup Tag Description AJ-LT-U-STD-PAY-US Azure AD Joined Laptop, assigned to a User, with no Admin rights, in Payroll in the United States HJ-DT-S-ADM-FIN-UK Hybrid Azure AD Joined Desktop, configured as a Shared Device, with Admin rights, in Finance in the United Kingdom Dynamic Groups # Now that we have sorted out the syntax and conventions, it\u0026rsquo;s now time to create some dynamic groups in Azure AD. We\u0026rsquo;re not only going to create specific groups that equal the Group Tag, but groups that match the Group Tag. This allows assignment of Deployment Profiles, Configuration Profiles and Applications to all device types in a dynamic way, alleviating the need to manually manage groups.\nExample Groups # The below dynamic query would contain all Azure AD Joined Autopilot Laptops:\n(device.devicePhysicalIds -any _ –startsWith \u0026#34;[OrderID]:AJ-LT\u0026#34;) This one contains all the Autopilot Desktops in Finance, whether Hybrid Joined or Azure AD Joined:\n(device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -match \u0026#34;^\\[OrderID\\]:.*DT.*FIN.*\u0026#34;)) This this one with all Laptops in France:\n(device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -match \u0026#34;^\\[OrderID\\]:.*LT.*FR$\u0026#34;)) And this this one with all Azure AD joined Laptops with Admin users in Payroll in all countries:\n(device.devicePhysicalIds -any (_ -match \u0026#34;^\\[OrderID\\]:AJ-LT.*ADM-PAY.*\u0026#34;)) You get the picture\u0026hellip;the possibilities for both the syntax and the dynamic groups using Regex are pretty much endless, and should be tailored to how you manage devices in Microsoft Intune.\nApplication # With the creation of these groups, you can now assign, well, pretty much anything in Microsoft Intune, to them.\nLets say you want all Laptops to have a BitLocker Endpoint Protection profile, but not Desktops\u0026hellip;you can do this. What about assigning an application to all HR devices that are Hybrid Joined, yup, you can do that too.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re really all up in there with Microsoft Intune, you\u0026rsquo;re probably using Role Based Access Control (RBAC), these groups also allow for segregated management of devices based on location, department, join type etc. for specific User Roles or permission such as Remote Wipe or Application Deployment\u0026hellip;I know, exciting.\nSummary # What we have here, is a relatively painless way of tagging devices in any way you want to, kind of like creating a classic Organisational Structure but way more interesting and with the ability to do so without being constrained to a flat structure.\nThe next step is to clearly define your naming convention and syntax for the Group Tags, and have fun I guess.\nNow if you\u0026rsquo;re asking how to tag these devices on mass, without having to manually do so, well that\u0026rsquo;s another post.\n","date":"28 April 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/autopilot-power-of-group-tags/","section":"Posts","summary":"A hidden gem with Autopilot service, is the Group Tag attribute for Autopilot devices, this tag can be provided during the pre-registration by a supplier or OEM, and can be configured or updated after the device has been imported.

And what if you need to make changes? What about if you have exceptions?\nCustom Configuration Template # I\u0026rsquo;m not going to detail all of these NCSC settings in this post, otherwise I\u0026rsquo;ll do myself out of a job, but I can help with the security settings don\u0026rsquo;t exist natively within the macOS Device Restriction template.\nAll the below security settings utilise the Custom configuration template for macOS\u0026hellip;straight from the horses mouth:\n\u0026ldquo;The custom configuration template allows IT admins to assign settings that aren\u0026rsquo;t built into Intune yet.
