      <title>Forcing Windows 11 Feature Update Readiness Assessments</title>

      <description>As a migration to Windows 11 is fast upon us, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d help your devices on their way into understanding whether they will support Windows 11 and what risks you may encounter with the update, by forcing devices to evaluate their readiness states.</description>

      <title>Converting AppLocker Policies to Intune Profiles</title>

      <description>We know that there is no native configuration for AppLocker in Intune, and we should be looking at App Control for Business already, but there is still a place for AppLocker, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t got time to manually do anything, so let&amp;rsquo;s use PowerShell to create out AppLocker policies from exported XML files.</description>

      <title>Scheduling macOS Defender Antivirus Scans in Intune</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;d think creating Defender antivirus scan schedules should be pretty easy, even if the devices you&amp;rsquo;re working with are running macOS. Why are we having to create mobileconfig files for this in Microsoft Intune? Surely we can make this a little better?</description>

      <description>This is the last part in the series around the CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmark for Windows 11, and we&amp;rsquo;d like to say that we&amp;rsquo;ve saved the best post for last, but we&amp;rsquo;d be lying. Surely the Level 2 settings can&amp;rsquo;t be worse than the Level 1?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what I&amp;rsquo;m doing playing around with Power Automate, but here we are. Like many people, I have a habit of forgetting to set an Out of Office message when I&amp;rsquo;m actually on holiday, or when I&amp;rsquo;m working with customers. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can make something do this for us.</description>

      <description>When did Microsoft go all covert ops (maybe don&amp;rsquo;t answer that question) and start making changes to your very own Firewall Rule policies in Microsoft Intune without letting anyone know? Or did they?</description>

      <description>The impact of the CIS settings on BitLocker and Windows Autopilot now done and dusted, we should broaden our horizons and start to look at what other problems the CIS level 1 benchmark brings to Windows 11 as a whole. Are there any? Will it be smooth sailing? Yeah, no.</description>

      <description>So Microsoft released Windows Autopilot Device Preparation, or more commonly known as APv2, into General Availability a little while ago. So with this production release we should be able to name our corporate owned Windows devices right Microsoft? Right?</description>

      <description>With the CIS BitLocker and associated DMA settings reviewed and updated, now is time to delve into the Windows 11 specific settings that exist in the CIS Level 1 benchmark. What issues do they bring to Windows Autopilot, what solutions can we find? Honestly, who knows.</description>

      <description>Everyone loves a security benchmark, and with the imminent move to Windows 11 for everyone, the Center for Internet Security released version 3.0.1 of theirs, including a build kit for Microsoft Intune, but what does this build kit break for BitLocker encryption?</description>

      <description>With all this chat about macOS device management in Microsoft Intune, I wonder how many people are macOS users but still need to test Microsoft Intune settings on Windows devices? Well fear not, there is a way to deploy a Windows Autopilot Virtual machine on your macOS device for testing.</description>

      <description>Having looked into capturing the Feature Update Readiness data for Windows 11 23H2 for our Windows devices, we can now use this risk based data to tag them with their associated risk, grouping them together to allow for sensible Feature Update profile assignment.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>
