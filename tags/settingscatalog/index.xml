      <title>Creating Reusable Groups of Firewall Settings for Microsoft Online Services</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been living under a rock, or you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with firewall and proxy requirements for accessing Microsoft Online services, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t be aware that Microsoft publish their URLs and IP addresses for their services using a web service.
Sadly I don&amp;rsquo;t live under a rock, and when I get the pleasure working with customers who are blocking all inbound and outbound traffic from Windows devices unless there is a matching firewall rule, getting these devices to talk to Microsoft Intune and other Microsoft services, can be a bit of a pain without the web service as a reference.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced the joys of migrating Group Policy and in particular Windows Defender Firewall rules away from Group Policy to Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably encountered the Rule Migration Tool, and for now this tool has worked well, beavering away grabbing firewall rules from a source Windows 10 or later device and punting them straight in Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <description>Fresh off the back of a trawl of a Modern Endpoint Management LinkedIn group, someone wanted the ability to assign existing Settings Catalog profiles in Microsoft Intune to additional Groups&amp;hellip;this sounded like a quick win if you fancy manually doing it, but no one wants that, and as I had experience of dealing with the logic when assigning apps, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Endpoint Privilege Management in Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve found, begged for, borrowed or stolen the money for shiny new Intune Suite or EPM licenses, and in you&amp;rsquo;re excitement you&amp;rsquo;ve gone and deployed a new policy to audit using the Reporting Scope options, all elevations across your managed Windows 10 and later devices.</description>
