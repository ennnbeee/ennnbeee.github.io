      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re almost there now; we&amp;rsquo;ve generated and captured the data from a Feature Update Readiness Report and we&amp;rsquo;ve tagged and grouped devices based on their readiness state using Dynamic Security Groups.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d strongly suggest, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, skimming over the first part of this series as this will give you a good understanding of where we started, and hopefully where we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get to with putting the Feature Update Readiness Reports in Microsoft Intune to good use allowing for a risk based deployment approach of Windows 11 23H2.</description>

      <description>At the time of writing we are only a few hundred days away from the end of support of Windows 10 22H2, and really we should all be recommending the move to Windows 11, not just because it&amp;rsquo;s shiny and new, but also it&amp;rsquo;s going to actually get security updates.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been living under a rock, or you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with firewall and proxy requirements for accessing Microsoft Online services, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t be aware that Microsoft publish their URLs and IP addresses for their services using a web service.</description>

      <description>Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve spent time getting your Windows devices enrolled into Intune, they&amp;rsquo;re all getting Device Compliance policies, and you&amp;rsquo;ve finally pulled the trigger on your shiny new Conditional Access Policy that require device compliance for all your users across Windows devices, and low and behold, you&amp;rsquo;ve broken access to Microsoft 365 authenticated services from your Remote Desktop service environment, or even VDI environments.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced the joys of migrating Group Policy and in particular Windows Defender Firewall rules away from Group Policy to Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably encountered the Rule Migration Tool, and for now this tool has worked well, beavering away grabbing firewall rules from a source Windows 10 or later device and punting them straight in Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <guid>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/managing-intune-assignment-settingscatalog/</guid>
      <description>Fresh off the back of a trawl of a Modern Endpoint Management LinkedIn group, someone wanted the ability to assign existing Settings Catalog profiles in Microsoft Intune to additional Groups&amp;hellip;this sounded like a quick win if you fancy manually doing it, but no one wants that, and as I had experience of dealing with the logic when assigning apps, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it a go.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Endpoint Privilege Management in Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve found, begged for, borrowed or stolen the money for shiny new Intune Suite or EPM licenses, and in you&amp;rsquo;re excitement you&amp;rsquo;ve gone and deployed a new policy to audit using the Reporting Scope options, all elevations across your managed Windows 10 and later devices.</description>

      <description>So what happens when you&amp;rsquo;re not using Windows Defender on your Windows 10 and later Microsoft Intune enrolled devices, and you&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the basic compliance checks for Third-Party Antivirus products?</description>

      <description>No one, and I mean no one, really wants to manually and individually assign Mobile Apps to Users or Devices in Intune, especially after you&amp;rsquo;ve happily used a script to Approve Managed Google Play Apps in their 100&amp;rsquo;s as part of migrating to Microsoft Intune from other below par Mobile Device Management solutions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go over old ground in too much detail, as I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered the importance of keeping your Operating System Compliance Policies up to date in line with the release of new updates, as well as a way to update your compliance policies using Graph and PowerShell.</description>

      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve made the financial sensible decision to migrate to Microsoft Intune for your Apple device management needs, you&amp;rsquo;ve got your Apple Push Certificate, sorted your Enrolment Token, added Intune as an MDM provider, and now you&amp;rsquo;ve got all your iOS/iPadOS devices happily sitting synchronised in Intune waiting to be deployed using Apple&amp;rsquo;s Automated Device Enrolment.</description>

      <description>With the impending retirement of the Azure AD Graph API and ADAL authentication methods, and by impending, I mean the end of 2022, we should probably look at how we move away from the existing authentication methods I&amp;rsquo;ve been using in all of my scripts and into the new realms of MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library).</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all had to add Managed Google Play Apps in bulk to Microsoft Intune for your Android Enterprise enrolled devices, whether this is just the raft of Microsoft Apps now that all your data is in Office 365, or the hundreds you have in a rival MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution that you&amp;rsquo;re looking to migrate away from.</description>
