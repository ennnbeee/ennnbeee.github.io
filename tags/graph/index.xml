      <guid>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/windows-applocker-intune/</guid>
      <description>We know that there is no native configuration for AppLocker in Intune, and we should be looking at App Control for Business already, but there is still a place for AppLocker, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t got time to manually do anything, so let&amp;rsquo;s use PowerShell to create out AppLocker policies from exported XML files.</description>

      <description>Using the data captured from a Windows 11 Feature Update Readiness report to successfully tag device attributes to device objects, and group them based on risk, we now look at how to deploy Feature Updates to these devices in a controlled manner.</description>

      <description>Having looked into capturing the Feature Update Readiness data for Windows 11 23H2 for our Windows devices, we can now use this risk based data to tag them with their associated risk, grouping them together to allow for sensible Feature Update profile assignment.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time to remove another manual process, this time the creation of Microsoft 365 network endpoints for Windows Firewall Rules in Microsoft Intune, because nobody should be creating these manually.</description>

      <description>So you like Intune Device Compliance and the integration with Conditional Access, what about if you&amp;rsquo;ve got VDI or Remote Desktop infrastructure that you want to exclude from specific policies, how do you go about that in a safe and controlled way.</description>

      <description>No one, and I mean no one, really wants to manually and individually assign Mobile Apps to Users or Devices in Intune in their 100&amp;rsquo;s, so we should find a solution for this bulk assignment approach.</description>

      <description>Apple devices shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be exempt from Operating System compliance policies, and these policies should share the same fate as Windows ones, and be updated monthly in line with update release cycles.</description>
