      <description>Using the data captured from a Windows 11 Feature Update Readiness report to successfully tag device attributes to device objects, and group them based on risk, we now look at how to deploy Feature Updates to these devices in a controlled manner.</description>

      <description>Having looked into capturing the Feature Update Readiness data for Windows 11 23H2 for our Windows devices, we can now use this risk based data to tag them with their associated risk, grouping them together to allow for sensible Feature Update profile assignment.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at deploying Microsoft and Windows Updates using Microsoft Intune, this time we look at different ways to phase our deployments across a device estate.</description>

      <description>You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune..</description>

      <title>Dynamic Groups vs Device Filters</title>
      <link>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/endpoint-manager-device-filters/</link>

      <description>Now if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.</description>
