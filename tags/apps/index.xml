      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at deploying backgrounds for Microsoft Teams on macOS, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we answered an internet strangers question, and hopefully my scripting has come on a little way since then (spoiler: it hasn&amp;rsquo;t).</description>

      <description>What happens when a stranger on the Internet asks you to look at something they&amp;rsquo;ve got a problem with? Well clearly you jump at the chance and hope that it&amp;rsquo;s not a body part this time.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all had to add Managed Google Play Apps in bulk to Microsoft Intune for your Android Enterprise enrolled devices, whether this is just the raft of Microsoft Apps now that all your data is in Office 365, or the hundreds you have in a rival MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution that you&amp;rsquo;re looking to migrate away from.</description>

      <description>What if you&amp;rsquo;ve only got Microsoft Intune to configure your Dell BIOS settings and not the glory that is Configuration Manager? How much do you like PowerShell, Win32 Apps and passwords in plain text?</description>
