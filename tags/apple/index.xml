      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>

      <description>This isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at deploying backgrounds for Microsoft Teams on macOS, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we answered an internet strangers question, and hopefully my scripting has come on a little way since then (spoiler: it hasn&amp;rsquo;t).</description>

      <description>We looked at some of the ways to secure macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, aligned with the NCSC platform guidance in macOS National Cyber Security Centre Security Settings in Intune, but this was when macOS device management in Intune was, at best, in beta.</description>

      <description>What happens when a stranger on the Internet asks you to look at something they&amp;rsquo;ve got a problem with? Well clearly you jump at the chance and hope that it&amp;rsquo;s not a body part this time.</description>

      <description>No one, and I mean no one, really wants to manually and individually assign Mobile Apps to Users or Devices in Intune, especially after you&amp;rsquo;ve happily used a script to Approve Managed Google Play Apps in their 100&amp;rsquo;s as part of migrating to Microsoft Intune from other below par Mobile Device Management solutions.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go over old ground in too much detail, as I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered the importance of keeping your Operating System Compliance Policies up to date in line with the release of new updates, as well as a way to update your compliance policies using Graph and PowerShell.</description>

      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve made the financial sensible decision to migrate to Microsoft Intune for your Apple device management needs, you&amp;rsquo;ve got your Apple Push Certificate, sorted your Enrolment Token, added Intune as an MDM provider, and now you&amp;rsquo;ve got all your iOS/iPadOS devices happily sitting synchronised in Intune waiting to be deployed using Apple&amp;rsquo;s Automated Device Enrolment.</description>

      <description>Everyone likes managing clients apps in Microsoft Intune, the grind of packing Windows apps, the chore of selecting Managed Google Play apps, the joy of assigning Apple VPP app licenses in Apple Business Manager&amp;hellip;all good fun.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to implement baseline security settings, whether this be Centre for Internet Security (CIS), Cyber Security Essentials (CSE), or National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have encountered some level of pain when it comes to non-Microsoft devices, as the guidance, is, well, complicated.</description>
