      <description>Using the data captured from a Windows 11 Feature Update Readiness report to successfully tag device attributes to device objects, and group them based on risk, we now look at how to deploy Feature Updates to these devices in a controlled manner.</description>

      <description>Having looked into capturing the Feature Update Readiness data for Windows 11 23H2 for our Windows devices, we can now use this risk based data to tag them with their associated risk, grouping them together to allow for sensible Feature Update profile assignment.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>

      <description>Now we all love the new Windows Store, especially for deploying applications from Microsoft Intune, but we should find a way to keep these UWP applications up to date without additional license cost.</description>

      <description>When Microsoft releases an update that won&amp;rsquo;t install due to the size of a Recovery partition, what do you do? Follow the manual steps provided by Microsoft or blindly follow a script created by a stranger on the internet?</description>

      <description>You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune..</description>

      <description>Apple devices shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be exempt from Operating System compliance policies, and these policies should share the same fate as Windows ones, and be updated monthly in line with update release cycles.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Windows 10 and above Operating System Compliance in Microsoft Intune, and specifically how using &amp;lsquo;Minimum OS Version&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Maximum OS Version&amp;rsquo; is dumb and you should definitely check yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re using this in your environment.</description>
