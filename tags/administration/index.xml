      <description>With the impending retirement of the Azure AD Graph API and ADAL authentication methods, and by impending, I mean the end of 2022, we should probably look at how we move away from the existing authentication methods I&amp;rsquo;ve been using in all of my scripts and into the new realms of MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library).</description>

      <description>What happens if you&amp;rsquo;ve allowed Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS devices to enrol into Microsoft Microsoft Intune in all kinds of ways, and now you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where devices that should be marked as corporate are marked as personal or unknown?</description>

      <description>Now if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.</description>

      <description>Ever had to add notes to Intune Managed Devices in bulk? Me either, well not until a few weeks ago when I needed an easy way to update the notes field on 100&amp;rsquo;s of devices.</description>
