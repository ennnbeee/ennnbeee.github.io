      <description>What happens if you&amp;rsquo;ve allowed Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS devices to enrol into Microsoft Microsoft Intune in all kinds of ways, and now you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where devices that should be marked as corporate are marked as personal or unknown?</description>
