      <description>No one, and I mean no one, really wants to manually and individually assign Mobile Apps to Users or Devices in Intune, especially after you&amp;rsquo;ve happily used a script to Approve Managed Google Play Apps in their 100&amp;rsquo;s as part of migrating to Microsoft Intune from other below par Mobile Device Management solutions.</description>

      <description>So it turns out that Android based MTR (Microsoft Teams Rooms) want to enrol into Microsoft Intune using what we generally term as a legacy enrolment method in Android Device Administrator, one in fact, that is recommended to be disabled for &amp;lsquo;All Users&amp;rsquo; as it will take priority over Android Enterprise Personal Device Work Profile enrolment for personal device or BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) scenarios.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all had to add Managed Google Play Apps in bulk to Microsoft Intune for your Android Enterprise enrolled devices, whether this is just the raft of Microsoft Apps now that all your data is in Office 365, or the hundreds you have in a rival MDM (Mobile Device Management) solution that you&amp;rsquo;re looking to migrate away from.</description>

      <description>Everyone likes managing clients apps in Microsoft Intune, the grind of packing Windows apps, the chore of selecting Managed Google Play apps, the joy of assigning Apple VPP app licenses in Apple Business Manager&amp;hellip;all good fun.</description>

      <description>We have already looked at allowing Android Enterprise enrolment using Mobile Data in a previous post, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at some of the other provisioning values that can be used to create a custom enrolment QR Code.</description>

      <description>With the change to Android 10+ requiring a wireless network to go through the Fully Managed device enrolment, you may be asking, &amp;ldquo;Well what if my users don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a wireless network?</description>
