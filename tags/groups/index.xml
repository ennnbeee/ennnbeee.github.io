      <title>Risk Based Windows 11 Feature Update Deployment - Feature Updates</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re almost there, we&amp;rsquo;ve generated and captured the data from a Feature Update Readiness Report and we&amp;rsquo;ve tagged and grouped devices based on their readiness state using Dynamic Security Groups. All of this is useful for when deploying a Window 11 Feature Update, in this instance 23H2, to devices, so let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we actually deploy the Feature Update to these groups of devices.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;d strongly suggest, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, skimming over the first part of this series as this will give you a good understanding of where we started, and hopefully where we&amp;rsquo;re trying to get to with putting the Feature Update Readiness Reports in Microsoft Intune to good use allowing for a risk based deployment approach of Windows 11 23H2.</description>

      <title>Software Update Deployment Rings for Managed macOS Devices</title>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>

      <title>Risk Based Windows 11 Feature Update Deployment - Reporting</title>

      <description>At the time of writing we are only a few hundred days away from the end of support of Windows 10 22H2, and really we should all be recommending the move to Windows 11, not just because it&amp;rsquo;s shiny and new, but also it&amp;rsquo;s going to actually get security updates.</description>

      <title>A Flexible Approach to Microsoft Update Deployments</title>

      <description>So this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at improving the management of updates using Microsoft Intune, and probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time either, especially with declarative device management looming, for Apple and hopefully Windows devices, covering configuration of software updates.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Phased Windows Update for Business Deployments</title>

      <description>You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Groups vs Device Filters</title>
      <link>https://memv.ennbee.uk/posts/endpoint-manager-device-filters/</link>

      <description>Now if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever spoken to me about Microsoft Intune and using Dynamic Groups for management of users and devices, I probably would have talked your ears off about the attribute usage, which attributes are suitable, and that moving away from assigned groups to dynamic is the only way forward for Modern Device Management.</description>
