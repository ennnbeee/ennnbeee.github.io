      <description>Now that you&amp;rsquo;ve made the financial sensible decision to migrate to Microsoft Intune for your Apple device management needs, you&amp;rsquo;ve got your Apple Push Certificate, sorted your Enrolment Token, added Intune as an MDM provider, and now you&amp;rsquo;ve got all your iOS/iPadOS devices happily sitting synchronised in Intune waiting to be deployed using Apple&amp;rsquo;s Automated Device Enrolment.</description>

      <description>So it turns out that Android based MTR (Microsoft Teams Rooms) want to enrol into Microsoft Intune using what we generally term as a legacy enrolment method in Android Device Administrator, one in fact, that is recommended to be disabled for &amp;lsquo;All Users&amp;rsquo; as it will take priority over Android Enterprise Personal Device Work Profile enrolment for personal device or BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) scenarios.</description>

      <description>What happens if you&amp;rsquo;ve allowed Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS devices to enrol into Microsoft Microsoft Intune in all kinds of ways, and now you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where devices that should be marked as corporate are marked as personal or unknown?</description>

      <title>Retrofitting Windows Autopilot Group Tags</title>

      <description>Now I don&amp;rsquo;t think I promised that I&amp;rsquo;d cover off bulk tagging Autopilot devices in a previous post, but you know, I was running low on things to write about. So here we are.
As I like to practice what I preach, I&amp;rsquo;d left myself the task of updating 1000&amp;rsquo;s of Autopilot devices with a new Group Tag after a successful Proof-of-Concept implementation of a suitable convention and syntax.</description>

      <description>We have already looked at allowing Android Enterprise enrolment using Mobile Data in a previous post, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at some of the other provisioning values that can be used to create a custom enrolment QR Code.
Configuration # This time, it&amp;rsquo;s adding in a WiFi profile, to allow the devices to auto-connect as part of the enrolment process&amp;hellip;anything to make life easier for users.</description>

      <title>The Hidden Power of Windows Autopilot Group Tags</title>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re using Windows Autopilot in some shape or form to deploy Windows 10/11 devices to your users, and you&amp;rsquo;re probably already familiar with the Autopilot dynamic group queries used for targetting these devices, right? Good.
So what if you have multiple deployment profiles, or different device use cases with the same profile, or different user personas, or test and pilot deployments, or a range of applications, configurations or scripts that you want to separate out to the devices or users of the devices?</description>

      <description>With the change to Android 10+ requiring a wireless network to go through the Fully Managed device enrolment, you may be asking, &amp;ldquo;Well what if my users don&amp;rsquo;t have access to a wireless network?&amp;rdquo;, don&amp;rsquo;t fret, with a bit of effort you can regenerate a new QR code that allows the use of Mobile Data.</description>
