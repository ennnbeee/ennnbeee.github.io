      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled the trigger on managing macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, and with this year being the year of macOS for Microsoft (this seems like an oxymoron), you should probably look at how to handle software updates.</description>

      <title>Remediating BitLocker DMA Exception Errors with Microsoft Intune</title>

      <description>Silently encrypting Windows 10 and later devices in Microsoft Intune isn&amp;rsquo;t anything new, removing reliance on Administrator permissions to encrypt a device during either Windows Autopilot or otherwise, as long as your configuration meets the pre-requisites and you&amp;rsquo;re only using a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) as a pre-boot authentication method.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been living under a rock, or you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with firewall and proxy requirements for accessing Microsoft Online services, you probably won&amp;rsquo;t be aware that Microsoft publish their URLs and IP addresses for their services using a web service.</description>

      <description>So this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve looked at improving the management of updates using Microsoft Intune, and probably won&amp;rsquo;t be the last time either, especially with declarative device management looming, for Apple and hopefully Windows devices, covering configuration of software updates.</description>

      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;re all onboard with the New Microsoft Store, and deploying both UWP and Win32 apps from Microsoft Intune is an absolute breeze, and reduces the effort of deploying applications to a click click next OK exercise.</description>

      <description>Imagine you&amp;rsquo;ve spent time getting your Windows devices enrolled into Intune, they&amp;rsquo;re all getting Device Compliance policies, and you&amp;rsquo;ve finally pulled the trigger on your shiny new Conditional Access Policy that require device compliance for all your users across Windows devices, and low and behold, you&amp;rsquo;ve broken access to Microsoft 365 authenticated services from your Remote Desktop service environment, or even VDI environments.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever experienced the joys of migrating Group Policy and in particular Windows Defender Firewall rules away from Group Policy to Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably encountered the Rule Migration Tool, and for now this tool has worked well, beavering away grabbing firewall rules from a source Windows 10 or later device and punting them straight in Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <description>You might have been asked the question, especially from organisations that currently utilise Microsoft Configuration Manager, about how you mimic existing Device Collections used for Software Update deployments in Microsoft Intune.</description>

      <description>We looked at some of the ways to secure macOS devices in Microsoft Intune, aligned with the NCSC platform guidance in macOS National Cyber Security Centre Security Settings in Intune, but this was when macOS device management in Intune was, at best, in beta.</description>

      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re interested in Endpoint Privilege Management in Microsoft Intune, you&amp;rsquo;ve found, begged for, borrowed or stolen the money for shiny new Intune Suite or EPM licenses, and in you&amp;rsquo;re excitement you&amp;rsquo;ve gone and deployed a new policy to audit using the Reporting Scope options, all elevations across your managed Windows 10 and later devices.</description>

      <description>So what happens when you&amp;rsquo;re not using Windows Defender on your Windows 10 and later Microsoft Intune enrolled devices, and you&amp;rsquo;re not happy with the basic compliance checks for Third-Party Antivirus products?</description>

      <description>So one of those rainy days is here, finally, and as I mentioned in a previous post many months ago, I said I&amp;rsquo;d look at ways to update other update based compliance policies periodically.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about Windows 10 and above Operating System Compliance in Microsoft Intune, and specifically how using &amp;lsquo;Minimum OS Version&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Maximum OS Version&amp;rsquo; is dumb and you should definitely check yourself if you&amp;rsquo;re using this in your environment.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever had to implement baseline security settings, whether this be Centre for Internet Security (CIS), Cyber Security Essentials (CSE), or National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), you&amp;rsquo;ll probably have encountered some level of pain when it comes to non-Microsoft devices, as the guidance, is, well, complicated.</description>

      <description>You may have enabled and configure BitLocker for silent encryption on your Windows 10 Autopilot joined devices, but have you had the headache of devices that don&amp;rsquo;t have a Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) configured?</description>
