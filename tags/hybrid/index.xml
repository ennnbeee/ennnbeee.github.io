      <description>Nothing has really changed in the Hybrid Join Autopilot space when it comes to device names, and we&amp;rsquo;re still stuck with useless naming conventions for these devices; sometimes a prefix and random characters just isn&amp;rsquo;t a good enough identification method for Windows devices.
So now that it&amp;rsquo;s 2023 it was time to look at this problem once again, mainly because my old solution broke device certificates and an Always On VPN connection that relied on them as part of the Autopilot process.</description>

      <title>Renaming Windows Autopilot Hybrid Joined Devices</title>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;ve probably hit the limitation with Windows Autopilot Hybrid Azure AD Join deployments and the device name templates being less than flexible, restricting to only a prefix and, well, that&amp;rsquo;s it.
You&amp;rsquo;ve also probably been asked whether you can configure the device name to match an asset tag or another unique bit of information, well this script, adapted from an existing one by Michael Niehaus can help.</description>
